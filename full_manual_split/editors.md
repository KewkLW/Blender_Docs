## Asset Browser

.. index:: Editors; Asset Browser

*************
Asset Browser
*************

This section describes the *Asset Browser*, which is the main interface for organizing and using assets.

The Asset Browser was introduced in Blender 3.0, and will be improved and
expanded over multiple upcoming releases.

.. seealso::

   :doc:`/files/asset_libraries/index`
      For general information on Blender's asset library system, including how to
      :ref:`create <asset-create>` and :ref:`edit <asset-edit>` assets, and design choices.

   :doc:`/files/asset_libraries/catalogs`
      For organizing assets.

   :doc:`/animation/armatures/posing/editing/pose_library`
      Build on top of the Asset Browser.


.. _bpy.ops.asset.catalog_undo:
.. _bpy.ops.asset.catalog_redo:

Interface
=========

.. figure:: /images/asset_browser-gold-material.png

   Asset Browser, showing materials in an asset library.


Main Region
-----------

The main region of the Asset Browser acts similar to the :doc:`/editors/file_browser` built into Blender.
It shows the assets contained in the selected catalog.

Click an asset to select and activate it. Box select by dragging :kbd:`LMB` or
extend the selection with :kbd:`Shift-LMB` to select multiple assets.
Every asset has a context menu.


Source List Region
------------------

The Source List region can be used for navigating and `Using Assets`_.

.. _bpy.types.FileAssetSelectParams.asset_library_ref:

Asset Library
   Shows the active :doc:`asset library </files/asset_libraries/index>`,
   and allows switching between asset libraries.
   The library ":ref:`Current File <asset-library-current-file>`" is special,
   and will always show the assets from the current blend-file,
   regardless of whether it is part of an asset library or not.

.. _bpy.ops.asset.bundle_install:

Copy Asset Bundle to Library
   Shown when the Library selector is set to Current File,
   the current blend-file file is considered an :ref:`Asset Bundle <asset-bundles>`,
   and is not yet located inside any asset library.

   The Copy Asset Bundle operator makes it simple to copy the file into the asset library.
   The catalogs of the asset bundle will be merged into the asset library.

Catalog
   Tree view that shows the :doc:`catalogs </files/asset_libraries/catalogs>` of the active asset library.
   Selecting a catalog limits shown assets to assets only from the selected library.

   Catalogs can be renamed by double clicking on there name.
   Catalogs can also be nested inside others by dragging and dropping one catalog into another.
   The "All" catalogs is built-in asset library that contains all other asset libraries.

Add-ons and features like the :doc:`/animation/armatures/posing/editing/pose_library`
can show custom panels here.


.. _bpy.types.AssetMetaData:
.. _editing-asset-metadata:

Asset Details Region
--------------------

The Asset Details region on the right shows metadata of the active asset.
**Only metadata of assets contained in the current blend-file can be edited**.

Name
   The asset data-block name. This name is unique for the asset data type within
   the same blend-file.

.. _bpy.types.WindowManager.asset_path_dummy:

Source
   The full path of the blend-file that contains the asset.

   .. _bpy.ops.asset.open_containing_blend_file:

   Open Blend File
      This button will start a new Blender instance and open the blend-file that contains the asset.
      In the background Blender will keep monitoring that new Blender instance;
      when it is quit, the Asset Browser will be refreshed to show any updated assets.

.. _bpy.types.AssetMetaData.description:

Description
   Optional field for the asset description. Not used by Blender itself.

.. _bpy.types.AssetMetaData.author:

Author
   Optional field for the asset author. Not used by Blender itself.


Preview
^^^^^^^

Shows the preview image of the asset. See :ref:`asset-previews`.

.. _bpy.ops.ed.lib_id_load_custom_preview:

Load Custom Preview
   Opens a window with the File Browser to select an image for the asset preview.

.. _bpy.ops.ed.lib_id_generate_preview:

Generate Preview
   Generate/update a preview for the asset.

Preview
   Menu of additional preview operators.

   .. _bpy.ops.ed.lib_id_generate_preview_from_object:

   Render Active Object
      Generates a preview by based on the 3D Viewport's :term:`Active` object.
      This is useful for node groups, particularly for geometry nodes,
      which cannot automatically generate their own preview.


.. _bpy.ops.asset.tag_add:
.. _bpy.ops.asset.tag_remove:
.. _bpy.types.AssetMetaData.active_tag:

Tags
^^^^

Panel for viewing and editing asset tags.
These do not have any meaning to Blender, and can be chosen freely.
When using the search field to filter the assets, those assets whose tags (partially) match
the search term will also be shown.

.. note::

   Depending on the current mode of the object and the selected asset types, more panels may be shown.
   For example, see :doc:`/animation/armatures/posing/editing/pose_library`.


.. _assets-using:

Using Assets
============

As a general rule, **an asset can be used by dragging it from the Asset Browser to the desired location**.
Objects and worlds can be dragged from the Asset Browser into the scene,
Materials can be dragged onto the object that should use them.
Geometry nodes can also be dragged onto objects to add a :doc:`/modeling/modifiers/generate/geometry_nodes`.
The use of pose assets is different, and is described in :doc:`/animation/armatures/posing/editing/pose_library`.

There are several things that can happen when an asset is used,
depending on the following configuration of the Asset Browser:

.. _bpy.types.FileAssetSelectParams.import_method:

Import Method
   Determines how data is managed when an asset is imported.
   This option can be found in the center of the Asset Browser header.

   :Follow Preferences:
      Use the import method set in the Preferences.
   :Link:
      *Same as* :menuselection:`File --> Link...`

      The asset will be linked to the current blend-file, and thus be read-only.
      Later changes to the asset file will be reflected in all files that link it in.
   :Append:
      *Same as* :menuselection:`File --> Append...`

      All of the asset and all its dependencies will be appended to the current file.
      Dragging a material into the scene three times will result in three independent copies.
      Dragging an object into the scene three times will also result in three independent copies.

      "Dependencies" in this case means everything the asset refers to.
      For an object, this can be its mesh and materials, but also other objects
      used by modifiers, constraints, or drivers.

      Since the file now has its own copy of the asset, later changes to
      the asset file will not be reflected in the file it's appended to.
   :Append (Reuse Data):
      *Specific to the Asset Browser*.

      The first time an asset is used, it will be appended, including its dependencies,
      just like described previously. However, Blender will keep track of where it originated,
      and the next time the asset is used, as much data as possible will be reused.
      Dragging a material into the scene three times will only load it once,
      and just assign the same material three times.
      Dragging an object into the scene three times will create three copies of the object,
      but all copies will share their mesh data, materials, etc.

      Since the file now has its own copy of the asset, later changes to
      the asset file will not be reflected in the file it's appended to.

      .. tip::

         **Instancing Collections**

         *Mimics the Instance Collections option when* :ref:`appending from the file browser <bpy.ops.wm.append>`

         Some asset types such as collections can be created as an instanced collection.
         This is done by enabling the *Instance* option after dragging collection assets into the 3D Viewport.
         By enabling this option an empty object is added that uses an instance of the collection.
         If this option is disabled then the full collection hierarchy will be added to the scene.

         Collection Assets from the current file will always be instanced.

Note that all regular Blender operations are available after the asset has been added to the current file.
For example, you could choose to link an object to the scene; this will also link its mesh and its materials.
Then you can make the object itself local
(:menuselection:`Object --> Relations --> Make Local... --> Selected Objects`),
while keeping the mesh and materials linked to the asset files. This will result in a local,
and thus editable, object, and keep the mesh and materials automatically up to date with
any changes in the asset library.


.. _asset-previews:

Asset Previews
==============

.. figure:: /images/asset-browser-preview-panel.png
   :align: right

   Preview panel in the Asset Browser.

Preview images are typically automatically generated when you
:ref:`mark a data-block as asset <bpy.ops.asset.mark>`. The auto-generated
preview tries to capture the object from the front. However this only works if
the geometry is laid out so that it matches what Blender considers to be the
front. That is, the geometry that should be the front needs to point down the -Y
axis of the object. The rotation may have to be applied to get the expected
result. Collection assets use the global -Y  axis as the front (instead of the
local one, as collections themselves don't have a rotation).

It's also possible to load image files from drive, to replace the auto-generated previews.

For previews of pose assets, see :ref:`poselib-preview-images`.


.. _asset-bundles:

Asset Bundles
=============

*Asset bundles* are blend-files that do not reference any other file,
and whose name ends in ``_bundle.blend``. Any textures and other external
files need to be :doc:`packed </files/blend/packed_data>` into the current blend-file.

Asset bundles can be copied to an asset library via the :ref:`Asset Browser <bpy.ops.asset.bundle_install>`:

- Open the asset bundle blend-file.
- Switch its Asset Browser to *Current File* (if it's not set at that already).
- Click on *Copy Bundle to Asset Library*.
- Choose the asset library to copy it to.
- A File Browser will open, showing the files of the selected asset library.
  Choose the desired location of the blend-file, and click the *Copy to Asset Library* button.
- The blend-file will be saved at the chosen location, and any :doc:`catalogs </files/asset_libraries/catalogs>` of
  the asset bundle will be merged into the target asset library.

.. note::

   Both the word "asset" and the word "bundle" are commonly used,
   and not necessarily with the same meaning as described here.
   Not everything that's presented as an "asset bundle" will have
   the *Copy to Asset Library* functionality available; for that,
   the bundle file needs to adhere to the definition above.


## Compositor

.. index:: Editors; Compositor

**********
Compositor
**********

The Compositor lets you manage nodes for compositing.

.. figure:: /images/compositing_types_distort_map-uv_example-2.png

   Nodes in the Compositor.

The use of the Compositor is explained in :doc:`/compositing/index`.


## Drivers Editor

.. index:: Editors; Drivers Editor

**************
Drivers Editor
**************

This editor lets you set up :doc:`Drivers </animation/drivers/index>`, which calculate the value for a property
based on other properties. In other words, they make a set of source properties "drive" the target property,
and can thus serve as an alternative to animating the property by hand.

.. figure:: /images/editors_drivers_introduction_example.png

   The Drivers Editor, showing how you might drive a cube's rotation based on its position.

The user interface is largely the same as that of the :doc:`Graph Editor </editors/graph_editor/introduction>`,
with two important differences:

- The Sidebar has an additional :doc:`Drivers tab </animation/drivers/drivers_panel>`. This is where
  the source properties are brought together to calculate an intermediate value for the target property.
- The curve doesn't represent the property's value over time, but a mapping from the above intermediate
  value (X axis) to the final value (Y axis).


## File Browser

.. index:: Editors; File Browser

.. _bpy.ops.file:
.. _bpy.types.FileSelectParams:
.. _bpy.types.SpaceFileBrowser:

************
File Browser
************

The File Browser is used in all the file-related operations. These include:

- Opening and saving blend-files.
- Browsing inside other blend-files, when appending or linking data-blocks,
  see :doc:`Linked Libraries </files/linked_libraries/index>`.
- Importing from/exporting to other file formats.
- Picking new locations for existing file paths (images, videos, fonts...).

The most common way to use this editor is through modal operators (like opening or saving a blend-file).
The File Browser will appear in a new window, waiting for the operation to complete,
and then close returning the main window.

You can use the File Browser as any other editor type, to browse through the file system.
The main purpose of this is to be able to drag-and-drop from the File Browser into other editors.

- Images into the :ref:`editors-3dview-index` (to set as background or apply as material texture).
- Media files into the :doc:`/video_editing/index`.

.. figure:: /images/editors_file-browser_editor.png

   The File Browser.


Interface
=========

Main Region
-----------

The main region of the File Browser acts similar to the file browser built into you operating system.
The region contains an array of files, folders, or internal blend-file data in a grid or list of items.
`Navigating`_, `selecting`_, and `editing`_ of these items works just as it would in your operating system's file
browser.

Hovering over items will show a tooltip with extra information about the file.


.. _file_browser-previews:

Previews
^^^^^^^^

In its *Thumbnail* display mode, the File Browser supports many types of previews. These include:

- Image and video formats
- Fonts
- Blend-files
- Internal :doc:`Data-blocks </files/data_blocks>`

In order to get previews for data-blocks, there previews must be generated.
See :doc:`Blend-files Previews </files/blend/previews>` for how to generate and manage Blender data previews.

.. figure:: /images/editors_file-browser_previews.png
   :align: center
   :width: 50%

   The File Browser in *Thumbnail* mode.


File Path Region
----------------

The File Path is above the main region and can aid in navigating and adjust how items are displayed.

.. _bpy.ops.file.previous:

Previous Folder :kbd:`Backspace`, :kbd:`Alt-Left`
   Move to previous folder (in navigation history).

.. _bpy.ops.file.next:

Next Folder :kbd:`Shift-Backspace`, :kbd:`Alt-Right`
   Move to next folder (in navigation history).

.. _bpy.ops.file.parent:

Parent File :kbd:`P`, :kbd:`Alt-Up`
   Move up to parent directory.

.. _bpy.ops.file.refresh:

Refresh File List :kbd:`R`, :kbd:`NumpadPeriod`
   Refresh current folder.

.. _bpy.ops.file.directory_new:

Create Directory :kbd:`I`
   Will ask you to confirm and create a new directory inside current one,
   scroll to it in the main view, and let you enter its name.

.. _bpy.types.FileSelectParams.directory:

File Path :kbd:`Ctrl-L`
   Text field for the current folder path.
   :kbd:`Tab` will auto-complete an existing path.
   If you type a nonexistent directory path, you will be prompted to create that new directory.

.. _bpy.types.FileSelectParams.filter_search:

Search :kbd:`Ctrl-F`
   Filter items by name.
   The wildcard ``*`` will match anything, e.g. ``bl*er`` will match both ``blender`` and ``blogger``.
   There is always an implicit wildcard at start and end of the search text,
   so ``blender`` will also match ``test_blender_file.blend``.
   This field can also be used to filter some specific file extension (e.g. ``.png`` will list all PNG files).

.. _bpy.types.FileSelectParams.display_type:

Display Mode
   Controls how files are displayed.

   :Vertical List: Displays files and folders in a vertical list.
   :Horizontal List: Displays files and folders in a horizontal list.
   :Thumbnails: Shows :ref:`previews <file_browser-previews>`.


Display Settings
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. _bpy.types.FileSelectParams.display_size:

Display Size
   The size of the thumbnails.

.. _bpy.types.FileSelectParams.recursion_level:

Recursion
   The number of directory levels to show at once in a flat way.

   :None: List only the current directory content.
   :Blend File: List the whole content of a blend-file (only available when linking or appending data-blocks).
   :One Levels: List all subdirectories' content, one level of recursion.
   :Two Levels: List all subdirectories' content, two level of recursion.
   :Three Levels: List all subdirectories' content, three levels of recursion.

   .. hint::

      Showing several levels of directories at once can be handy to e.g. see your whole collection of textures,
      even if you have arranged them in a nice set of directories to avoid having hundreds of
      files in a single place.

      In the *Append/Link* case, showing the content of the whole blend-file will allow you
      to link different types of data-blocks in a single operation.

   .. warning::

      The more levels you show at once, the more time it will take to list them all
      (typically, it will be exponential, showing three levels at once
      may take three orders of magnitude more time to be fully listed).

.. _bpy.types.FileSelectParams.sort_method:

Sort By
   Sorts items by one of the four methods:

   :Name: Sort the file list alphabetically.
   :Extension: Sort the file list by extension/type.
   :Modified Date: Sort files by modification time.
   :Size: Sort files by size.


.. _bpy.types.FileSelectParams.use_filter:

Filter Settings
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

On the right side of the file path are the filtering options.
The toggle with the funnel icon controls whether filtering is enabled or not.

File Types
   Filters files by categories, like folders, blend-files, images, etc.

.. _bpy.types.FileSelectIDFilter:

Blender IDs
   When appending or linking, you can also filter by data-block categories, like scenes, animations, materials, etc.

.. _bpy.types.FileSelectParams.show_hidden:

Show Hidden :kbd:`H`
   Shows hidden files (starting with a ``.``).


Execution Region
----------------

.. _bpy.types.FileSelectParams.filename:

File Name
   Text field to edit the file name and extension.
   When saving, if the background is red, a file with same name already exists in the folder.
   :kbd:`Tab` will auto-complete to existing names in the current directory.

   Increment Filename ``-``, ``+``
      Removes/Decreases or adds/increases a trailing number to your file name
      (used e.g. to store different versions of a file).

.. _bpy.ops.file.cancel:

Cancel :kbd:`Esc`
   Cancels the file selection (and the underlying operation), and closes the File Browser.
   Using the *Back to Previous* button in the :doc:`Topbar </interface/window_system/topbar>`
   will have the same effect.

.. _bpy.ops.file.execute:

Confirm :kbd:`Return`
   The main button to validate the operation, which defines its name.
   Double-clicking on a non-directory item will have the same effect.


Source List Region
------------------

The left region displays different ways to quickly access some directories.
The region is divided into separate panels each containing a :ref:`UI List <ui-list-view>` of directories.
Clicking on one of the directories will immediately navigate to that folder.


.. _bpy.types.SpaceFileBrowser.bookmarks:

Bookmarks
^^^^^^^^^

Contains folders that you want to be able to access often without having to navigate to them in the File Browser.
To the right of that list are buttons to perform basic management actions on your bookmarks,
e.g. add/remove an entry, move it up or down in the list, etc.


.. _bpy.types.SpaceFileBrowser.system_bookmarks:

System
^^^^^^

Contains OS-defined common directories, like the main user folder...


.. _bpy.types.SpaceFileBrowser.system_folders:

Volumes
^^^^^^^

Contains all OS-defined available volumes, e.g. drives or network mounts.


.. _bpy.types.SpaceFileBrowser.recent_folders:

Recent
^^^^^^

Contains recently accessed folders.

.. _bpy.ops.file.reset_recent:

Clicking the down arrow button to the right reveals *Clear Recent Items* to fully clear this list.

You can control how many folders appear in this list with the *Recent Files* number field
of the :ref:`Save & Load <prefs-save-load>` tab in the Preferences.


Operator Options Region
-----------------------

The right region shows the options of the calling operator.
Besides common actions listed below, many import/export add-ons will also expose their options there.

Open, Save, Save As Blender File
   See :doc:`/files/blend/open_save`.
Open, Replace, Save As Image
   See :doc:`/files/media/image_formats`.
Link/Append from Library
   See :doc:`Linked libraries </files/linked_libraries/index>`.

For the common option:

Relative Path
   See :ref:`files-blend-relative_paths`.


Header Region
-------------

The header only contains two menus, one with you standard editor *View* controls
and the other to list a few `Selecting`_ operators for the sake of discoverability.
Often it is hidden as most of the functionality is contained in the regions described previously.


Navigating
==========

Entering a Directory
   A single :kbd:`LMB` click on a directory enters it.
Parent Directory :kbd:`P`
   Takes you up one level of directory.


File Drop
---------

You can also drag and drop a file or directory from your file manager into the Blender File Browser.
This will move it to the directory of the dropped file, and the file will be selected.


Selecting
=========

Select
   Both :kbd:`LMB` and :kbd:`RMB` clicks work.
   Holding :kbd:`Shift` will extend the items selection.
(De)select All :kbd:`A`
   Toggles selecting all files.
Dragging
   Dragging with :kbd:`LMB` starts a :ref:`box selection <tool-select-box>`.

.. note::

   You can always select several entries in the File Browser,
   the last selected one is considered as the active one.
   If the calling operation expects a single path (like e.g. the main blend-file *Open* one),
   it will get that active item's path, other selected ones will just be ignored.


Arrow Keys
----------

It is also possible to select/deselect files by "walking" through them using the arrow keys:

- Just using an arrow key, the next file in the chosen direction will be selected and all others deselected.
- Holding down :kbd:`Shift` while doing this does not deselect anything so it extends to the selection,
  plus it allows to deselect files by navigating into a block
  of already selected ones (minimum two files in sequence).
- Holding down :kbd:`Shift-Ctrl` further selects/deselects all files in between.

If no file is selected, the arrow key navigation selects the first or last file in the directory,
depending on the arrow direction.

If you select a directory and hit :kbd:`Return`, you will go into that directory
(and highlighting 'parent' ``..`` entry will bring you up one level).


Editing
=======

.. _bpy.ops.file.external_operation:

External
   Use the operating system to perform an action on the file or directory.
   The options listed below might not be available on all operating systems.

   :Open: Open the file.
   :Open Folder: Open the folder.
   :Edit: Edit the file.

   :Run As User: Run as specific user.
   :Properties: Show OS Properties for this item.
   :Find in Folder: Search for items in this folder.
   :Command Prompt Here: Open a command prompt here.

.. _bpy.ops.file.delete:

Delete Files :kbd:`Delete`, :kbd:`X`
   Delete the currently selected files or directories by moving them to the operating system's "trash".

   Note, on Linux deleting directories requires KDE or GNOME.

.. _bpy.ops.file.rename:

Rename :kbd:`F2`
   Change the name for the currently selected file or directory.

Blender provides a number of different editors for displaying and modifying different aspects of data.
An Editor is contained inside an :doc:`Area </interface/window_system/areas>`
which determines its size and placement within the Blender window.
Every area may contain any type of editor.

The *Editor Type* selector, the first button at the left side of a header,
allows you to change the Editor in that area.
It is also possible to open the same Editor type in different areas at the same time.

See :doc:`User Interface </interface/index>` for documentation on the general interface.

The Properties editor shows and allows editing of many active data, including the active scene and object.


Tabs
====

The Properties editor has several categories, which can be chosen via tabs (the icons column to its left).
Each tab regroups properties and settings of a data type, and is documented in its own manual sections, linked below.


Active Tool and Workspace Settings
----------------------------------

This first tab contains settings for the active :doc:`tool </editors/3dview/toolbar/index>` (in the 3D Viewport)
and the current :doc:`workspace </interface/window_system/workspaces>`.


Scene
-----

These tabs contain settings for the active scene.

.. _properties-render-tab:

- Render: :doc:`EEVEE </render/eevee/index>`,
  :doc:`Cycles </render/cycles/render_settings/index>` or
  :doc:`Workbench </render/workbench/index>` settings
- :doc:`Output </render/output/index>`
- :doc:`View Layer </scene_layout/view_layers/index>`
- :doc:`Scene </scene_layout/scene/properties>`
- :doc:`World </render/lights/world>`


Collection
----------

This tabs contain settings for the active :ref:`Collection <scene-layout_collections_collections_tab>`.


.. _properties-data-tabs:

Object
------

These tabs are used to add features, and to change properties for the active object.
Depending on the type of the active object, some of those will be hidden.

- :doc:`Object </scene_layout/object/properties/index>`
- :doc:`Modifiers </modeling/modifiers/index>` (or :doc:`Grease Pencil Modifiers </grease_pencil/modifiers/index>`)
- :doc:`Object Visual Effects </grease_pencil/visual_effects/index>`
- :doc:`Particles </physics/particles/index>`
- :doc:`Physics </physics/index>`
- :doc:`Object Constraints </animation/constraints/index>`


Object Data
-----------

The main tab of that category (often the only one) always has the same name, *Object Data*,
but its icon will change based on the actual type of the active object.


.. rubric:: Geometry Objects:

- :doc:`Mesh </modeling/meshes/properties/object_data>`
- :doc:`Curve </modeling/curves/properties/index>`
- :doc:`Surface </modeling/surfaces/properties/index>`
- :doc:`Text </modeling/texts/properties>`
- :doc:`Metaball </modeling/metas/properties>`
- :doc:`Grease Pencil </grease_pencil/properties/index>`


.. rubric:: Rigging and Deformation Objects:

- :doc:`Armature </animation/armatures/properties/index>`

  - :doc:`Bone </animation/armatures/bones/properties/index>`
  - :doc:`Bone Constraints </animation/armatures/posing/bone_constraints/index>`

- :doc:`Lattice </animation/lattice>`


.. rubric:: Other Types of Objects:

- :doc:`Empty </modeling/empties>`
- :doc:`Speaker </render/output/audio/speaker>`
- :doc:`Camera </render/cameras>`
- :doc:`Light </render/lights/light_object>`
- :doc:`Light Probe </render/eevee/light_probes/index>`


Object Shading
--------------

Depending on the type of the active object, some of those will be hidden.

- :doc:`Material </render/materials/index>`
- :doc:`Texture </render/materials/legacy_textures/index>`


Header
======

.. figure:: /images/editors_properties-editor_top.png

   The header of the Properties.

.. _bpy.types.SpaceProperties.search_filter:

Display Filter :kbd:`Ctrl-F`
   Allows you to search for a property by its name.
   The results will be highlighted with there corresponding panel also highlighted and expanded.
   The search also works across multiple `Tabs`_; graying out tabs with no search results.
   You can start a search using :kbd:`Ctrl-F` or clear a search with :kbd:`Alt-F`.
   This filter is useful if you do not remember where a property is within the Properties.

Data Context
   Just below the header is a list of icons and text items which show the owner of the properties being edited,
   together with some dependency context if needed.
   In the example above, the material "Material" is used by the active object "Cube".

.. _bpy.ops.buttons.toggle_pin:

Toggle Pin ID
   By toggling on the pin icon to the right, Blender will display only the currently shown data-block's properties
   in that editor, disregarding further selection changes.
   Toggle off that pin to switch back to default behavior, showing active data-block's properties.


Options
-------

.. _bpy.types.SpaceProperties.outliner_sync:

Sync with Outliner
   Sync tabs with the Outliner data-block selection.
   See :ref:`editors-outliner-properties-sync` for more information.

   :Always: Always, when possible, change Property editor tabs when clicking an icon in an Outliner.
   :Never: Never change Property editor tabs when clicking an icon in an Outliner.
   :Auto: Change tabs only when the Property editor shares a border with an Outliner.

As an example, type ``bpy.`` and press :kbd:`Tab`:

.. figure:: /images/editors_python-console_completion.png

The submodules are listed in green. Attributes and methods will be listed
in the same way, with methods being indicated by a trailing ``(``.


Examples
========

bpy.context
-----------

This module gives you access to the current scene,
the currently selected objects, the current object mode, and so on.

.. note::

   For the commands below to show the proper output,
   make sure you have selected object(s) in the 3D Viewport.

.. figure:: /images/editors_python-console_bpy-context.png

Get the current 3D Viewport mode (Object, Edit, Sculpt, etc.)::

   bpy.context.mode

Get the active object::

   bpy.context.object
   bpy.context.active_object

Change the active object's X coordinate to 1::

   bpy.context.object.location.x = 1

Move the active object by 0.5 along the X axis::

   bpy.context.object.location.x += 0.5

Change all three location coordinates in one go::

   bpy.context.object.location = (1, 2, 3)

Change only the X and Y coordinates::

   bpy.context.object.location.xy = (1, 2)

Get the selected objects::

   bpy.context.selected_objects

Get the selected objects excluding the active one::

   [obj for obj in bpy.context.selected_objects if obj != bpy.context.object]


bpy.data
--------

Gives you access to all the data in the blend-file,
regardless of whether it's currently active or selected.

.. figure:: /images/editors_python-console_bpy-data.png


bpy.ops
-------

"Operators" are actions that are normally triggered from a button or menu item
but can also be called programmatically. See the
`bpy.ops <https://docs.blender.org/api/current/bpy.ops.html>`__
API documentation for a list of all operators.


## Shader Editor

.. index:: Editors; Shader Editor

*************
Shader Editor
*************

The Shader Editor is used to edit materials which are used for :doc:`rendering </render/index>`.
Materials used by Cycles and EEVEE are defined using a node tree.
Therefore, the main window of the Shader editor is a :doc:`node editor </interface/controls/nodes/index>`.

.. figure:: /images/editors_shader-editor_main.png

   Shader Editor with the default material node tree.

A list of all :doc:`shader nodes </render/shader_nodes/index>` is available in the rendering section.


Header
======

Use Nodes
   The Use Nodes setting is mostly a legacy setting and should always be checked for materials.
Slot
   The *Slot* menu can be used to select
   the active :ref:`material slot <bpy.types.MaterialSlot>` on the active object.
   The material selector to the right of it can change the material that is in the selected slot.
Pin (pin icon)
   The pin button will keep the current material selection fixed.
   When a material is pinned, it will remain visible in the Shader editor
   even when another object or material is selected elsewhere.


Sidebar
=======

Options
-------

The Options panel in the Sidebar region contains the same :doc:`settings </render/materials/settings>`
that are also available in the Material tab in the Properties.
They differ depending on the selected render engine.
The settings are duplicated to make it possible to edit the entire material from the Shader editor.


## Spreadsheet

.. index:: Editors; Spreadsheet

.. _bpy.ops.spreadsheet:
.. _bpy.types.SpaceSpreadsheet:

Header
======

.. _bpy.types.SpaceSpreadsheet.object_eval_state:

Object Evaluation State
   Display the data of an object at different states of its evaluation.

   :Evaluated: Display data from the object with all modifiers applied.
   :Original: Display data from the original object without any modifiers applied.
   :Viewer Node: Display data from the active Viewer node of the active object.

.. _bpy.types.SpaceSpreadsheet.display_context_path_collapsed:

Breadcrumbs
   The breadcrumbs show three key parts of the path the evaluated object
   takes before showing the information in the `Main Region`_.
   In the order from left to right, the first item displayed is the :term:`Active` object.
   The next two items are displayed when the *Viewer* node evaluation state is chosen.
   The first of these next items is the name of the Geometry Nodes modifier,
   the last item shown is the name of the active Viewer node.

   Clicking the arrow between items hides the name of the active modifier.

.. _bpy.ops.spreadsheet.toggle_pin:

Toggle Pin
   Usually, the editor displays data from the active object.
   When an object is pinned, its data remains visible, even if another object becomes active.

.. _bpy.types.SpaceSpreadsheet.show_only_selected:

Selected Only
   This option is only available if the object is in Edit Mode.
   When checked, only data for the selected mesh elements is shown.


Main Region
===========

The main view allows you to view the actual spreadsheet.
Row indices and column names remain visible when scrolling down or to the side.

.. note::

   Byte color attributes are displayed as scene linear floats.
   The actual byte values are displayed in a tooltip when hovering over the float values.


.. _bpy.types.SpaceSpreadsheet.geometry_component_type:
.. _bpy.types.SpaceSpreadsheet.attribute_domain:

Data Set Region
===============

With the Data Set region on the left you can choose which geometry component and geometry domain to view.
For each attribute domain its size is displayed, for example the number of faces.

Mesh
   Mesh component containing point, corner, face and edge data.

   :Vertex: Display attributes that are stored per vertex.
   :Edge: Display attributes that are stored per edge.
   :Face: Display attributes that are stored per face.
   :Face Corner: Display attributes that are stored per face corner.

Curve
   Display curve data which are the attributes on splines and control points.

   :Control Point: Display attributes that are stored per control point.
   :Spline: Display attributes that are stored per spline.

Point Cloud
   Point cloud component containing only point data.

   :Point: Display attributes that are stored per point.

Volume Grids
   Display OpenVDB volume grid data, each grid will be represented
   with the *Grid Name*, the *Data Type*, and the *Class*.
   The class can be either of: Fog Volume, Level Set, or Unknown.

.. _bpy.types.SpaceSpreadsheetRowFilter.enabled:

Enabled
   Each row filter can be enabled or disabled. Disabled row filters are grayed out, and aren't used for filtering.

.. _bpy.types.SpaceSpreadsheetRowFilter.column_name:

Column
   Row filters hide rows based on the values of the selected column.
   The choice of name in the Column field determine which column is chosen.
   If the column is not currently available, the row filter will be grayed out.

.. TODO 3.0 relink Attribute Convert node replacement tip:

   To filter values based on a geometry attribute on a different domain,
   the :doc:`Attribute Convert </modeling/geometry_nodes/attribute/attribute_convert>` node
   can be used to move an attribute's values to any of a geometry component's other domains.

.. _bpy.types.SpaceSpreadsheetRowFilter.operation:

Operation
   For spreadsheet column types besides Boolean columns and name or "string" columns,
   it is possible to choose which operation to filter with.

   :Equal To: Display the row when data values are within the provided threshold from the row filter's value.
   :Greater Than: Display the row when data values are greater than the row filter's value.
   :Less Than: Display the row when data values are less than the row filter's value.

.. _bpy.types.SpaceSpreadsheetRowFilter.threshold:

Threshold
   The distance from the row filter's value for the equality operation.


Status Bar
==========

The status bar shows how many rows and columns there are and how many have been filtered out.

********
Timeline
********

The *Timeline* editor is used to jump to different frames, manipulate keyframes,
and control animation playback.

.. figure:: /images/editors_timeline_interface.png

   The Timeline.


Main View
=========

The X axis represents time, with the numbers 0/50/100/... being frame numbers.
The blue line is the *Playhead* indicating the current frame,
and the diamond shapes are *Keyframes*, points where you specified
a certain value for a certain property at a certain time.


Adjusting the View
------------------

Panning is done by dragging :kbd:`MMB`.

Zooming is done by dragging :kbd:`Ctrl-MMB`, rolling the mouse :kbd:`Wheel`,
or pressing :kbd:`NumpadMinus`/:kbd:`NumpadPlus`.

You can also use the scrollbars located at the bottom and the right of the editor.


Playhead
--------

.. figure:: /images/editors_timeline_cursor.png
   :align: right

   Playhead.

The *Playhead* is the blue vertical line showing the current frame number.

It can be moved to a new position by clicking or
dragging :kbd:`LMB` in the scrubbing area at the top.

You can also move it in single-frame increments by pressing :kbd:`Left` or :kbd:`Right`,
or jump to the beginning or end frame by pressing :kbd:`Shift-Left` or :kbd:`Shift-Right`.


Frame Range
-----------

The *Frame Range* determines the length of the scene's animation.
By default, it's set to start at frame 1 and end at frame 250.
You can change this using the Start/End inputs in the Timeline header,
or in the :doc:`Output Properties </render/output/properties/frame_range>`.


Keyframes
---------

By default, the timeline only shows keyframes for selected items.
You can make it show all keyframes by unchecking
:menuselection:`View --> Only Show Selected`.

You can click a keyframe to select it (and deselect all others),
or click it while holding :kbd:`Shift` to add it to the selection
(or remove it if it was already selected). You can also drag a box
to select multiple keyframes in one go.

To move the selected keyframes, simply drag one of them. Alternatively,
you can press :kbd:`G`, move the mouse, and click :kbd:`LMB` to confirm
(or :kbd:`RMB` to cancel). You can also press :kbd:`S` to scale the keyframes
in relation to the Playhead.


Markers
-------

See the :doc:`Markers page </animation/markers>` for more information.


Header
======

.. _animation-editors-timeline-headercontrols:

.. figure:: /images/editors_timeline_header.png

   Popovers for Playback and Keying; transport controls; and frame controls

Popovers
--------

.. _timeline-playback:

Playback Popover
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. figure:: /images/editors_timeline_playback.png

.. _bpy.types.Scene.sync_mode:

Sync
   .. figure:: /images/editors_timeline_red-fps.png
      :figwidth: 109px
      :align: right

      3D Viewport red FPS.

   If animation playback can't keep up with the desired :ref:`Frame Rate <bpy.types.RenderSettings.fps>`,
   the actual frame rate (shown in the top left corner of the 3D Viewport) will turn red,
   and the *Sync* option determines how the situation should be handled.

   Play Every Frame
      Play every frame, even if this results in the animation playing slower than intended.
   Frame Dropping
      Drop frames if playback becomes slower than the scene's frame rate.
   Sync to Audio
      Drop frames if playback becomes too slow to remain synced with audio.

Audio
   Scrubbing
      Play bits of the sound in the animation (if there is any) while you drag the Playhead around.
   Play Audio
      Uncheck to mute all sound.

Playback
   Limit to Frame Range
      Don't allow moving the Playhead outside of the Frame Range using the mouse.

   .. _bpy.types.Screen.use_follow:

   Follow Current Frame
      Automatically pan the view to catch up when the Playhead goes off screen.

.. _bpy.types.Screen.use_play:

Play In
   Which editors to update on each animation frame. If an editor is unchecked,
   it'll only be updated once playback stops (with some exceptions where it'll
   update on each frame anyway). When starting playback in either the
   :doc:`Graph Editor </editors/graph_editor/introduction>`,
   :doc:`Dope Sheet </editors/dope_sheet/introduction>` or the
   :doc:`NLA Editor</editors/nla/introduction>`,
   all editors will play back regardless of the settings.
   This is a feature requested by animators to easily play back all views.

.. _bpy.types.Scene.show_subframe:

Show
   Subframes
      Display and allow changing the current scene subframe.

Set Start/End Frame
   Set the scene's start/end frame to the current frame.
   If the Preview Range is active (see `Frame Controls`_), that one is changed instead.

.. _timeline-keying:

Keying Popover
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. figure:: /images/editors_timeline_keying.png

The *Keying* popover contains options that affect keyframe insertion.

.. _bpy.types.KeyingSetsAll.active:

Active Keying Set
   .. figure:: /images/editors_timeline_keying-sets.png
      :align: right

      Timeline Keying Sets.

   A *Keying Set* is a named collection of animatable properties. If you select
   one and then press :kbd:`I` while not hovering over any input field,
   Blender will create keyframes for the properties in that keying set.

   If you don't have a keying set selected, you'll get keyframes on a default
   set of properties instead (e.g. Location/Rotation/Scale for objects).

   There are a number of predefined keying sets, but you can also create your own
   in the :ref:`Keying Sets <bpy.types.KeyingSets>` panel.

   Insert Keyframes (plus icon) :kbd:`I`
      Insert keyframes on the current frame.
   Delete Keyframes (cross icon) :kbd:`Alt-I`
      Delete keyframes on the current frame.

.. _bpy.types.ToolSettings.keyframe_type:

New Keyframe Type
   The :ref:`keyframe type <keyframe-type>` for newly created keyframes.

.. _bpy.types.ToolSettings.use_keyframe_cycle_aware:

Cycle-Aware Keying
   When inserting keyframes into :ref:`trivially cyclic curves <bpy.types.FModifierCycles>`,
   special handling is applied to preserve the cycle integrity (most useful while tweaking an established cycle):

   - If a key insertion is attempted outside of the main time range of the cycle,
     it is remapped back inside the range.
   - When overwriting one of the end keys, the other one is updated accordingly.

   In addition, when adding a new curve into an action with a
   :ref:`Manual Frame Range <bpy.types.Action.use_frame_range>`
   and *Cyclic Animation* enabled, the curve is automatically made cyclic with the period matching the frame range.
   For convenience, this check and conversion is also done before adding the second keyframe to such a curve.


.. Move to some content to animation?
.. _bpy.types.ToolSettings.use_keyframe_insert_auto:

Auto Keying
^^^^^^^^^^^

.. figure:: /images/editors_timeline_keyframes-auto.png
   :align: right

   Auto Keying button.

When the record button (|record|) is enabled, Blender will automatically create keyframes on the current
frame whenever you transform an object or bone in the 3D Viewport (or change one of its transform properties
in the :doc:`Properties Editor </editors/properties_editor>`).

One special use case is to record a camera path as you fly through the scene.
See :ref:`Fly/Walk Navigation <3dview-fly-walk>`.

.. note::

   Auto Keying only works for transform properties (Location, Rotation, Scale).
   It won't create a keyframe if you change, say, the color of a material --
   you still have to do that manually.

.. _bpy.types.ToolSettings.auto_keying_mode:

Mode
   Add & Replace
      Add or replace keyframes as needed.
   Replace
      Only replace existing keyframes.

.. _bpy.types.ToolSettings.use_keyframe_insert_keyingset:

Only Active Keying Set
   By default, Auto Keying will create keyframes even for properties that are not in the
   :ref:`active keying set <bpy.types.KeyingSetsAll.active>`. Use this checkbox to change that.

.. _bpy.types.ToolSettings.use_record_with_nla:

Layered Recording
   Adds a new :doc:`NLA Track </editors/nla/tracks>` for every pass made over the animation
   to allow non-destructive tweaking.


Menus
-----

.. _timeline-view-menu:

   The number of the frame that's currently being displayed in the 3D Viewport.
   This is also the location of the Playhead.
Use Preview Range (clock icon)
   The Preview Range is an alternative Frame Range that you can use for focusing on a
   particular part of the animation. It lets you repeatedly play a short segment without
   having to manually rewind or change the frame range of the entire scene.

   This range only affects the preview in the 3D Viewport; it doesn't affect rendering.

   The boundaries of the Preview Range are shown in dark orange. You can quickly configure
   and enable it by pressing :kbd:`P` and dragging a box. To disable it,
   you can press :kbd:`Alt-P`.
Start/End Frame
   The start/end frame of the scene (or the preview range, if active).


## 3D Cursor

.. _bpy.types.View3DCursor:
.. _editors-3dview-3d_cursor:

*********
3D Cursor
*********

The 3D Cursor is a point in space that has both a location and a rotation.
It's used for a number of purposes. For example, it defines where newly
added objects are placed, and can also be used to manually position and orient
the transform gizmo (see :doc:`Pivot Point </editors/3dview/controls/pivot_point/index>`
and :doc:`Transform Orientation </editors/3dview/controls/orientation>`).
Some tools, such as :doc:`Bend </modeling/meshes/editing/mesh/transform/bend>`,
also use the Cursor.


Placement
=========

There are a few methods to position the 3D Cursor.


.. _bpy.ops.view3d.cursor3d:

Direct Placement with the Mouse
-------------------------------

.. reference::

   :Mode:      Object, Edit, and Pose Mode
   :Tool:      Cursor
   :Shortcut:  :kbd:`Shift-RMB`

.. figure:: /images/editors_3dview_3d-cursor_two-view-positioning.png
   :align: center

   Positioning the 3D Cursor with two orthogonal views.

The Cursor tool offers the most flexibility. Simply select it in the Toolbar
and click a point in the scene with :kbd:`LMB` to place the 3D Cursor there.
In the tool settings, you can choose how it should be oriented:
by default, it matches the view orientation, but you can also make it
match the surface normal of a piece of geometry,
or the :doc:`transform orientation </editors/3dview/controls/orientation>`.

Alternatively, you can press :kbd:`Shift-RMB` with any tool selected.
In this case, the 3D Cursor will always be aligned to the view orientation.

For accuracy you should use two perpendicular orthogonal 3D Viewports,
i.e. any combination of top :kbd:`Numpad7`, front :kbd:`Numpad1` and side :kbd:`Numpad3`.
That way you can control the positioning along two axes in one view and
determine the depth in the other.

By default, the depth of the geometry under the cursor is used.
This can be disabled using the *Cursor Surface Project* toggle
in the :doc:`Preferences </editors/preferences/editing>`.


Sidebar
-------

.. reference::

   :Mode:      All Modes
   :Panel:     :menuselection:`Sidebar region --> View --> 3D Cursor`

.. figure:: /images/editors_3dview_3d-cursor_panel.png

   The 3D Cursor panel of the Sidebar region.

The 3D Cursor can also be positioned and oriented by editing the
respective values in the Sidebar.


Snapping
--------

.. reference::

   :Mode:      Object, Edit, and Pose Mode
   :Menu:      :menuselection:`Object/Mesh/... --> Snap --> Cursor to ...`
   :Shortcut:  :kbd:`Shift-S`

One more way of positioning the 3D Cursor is through the Snap menu,
which allows you to move the Cursor to the origin of the selected object
for example.

## Introduction

.. index:: Editors; 3D Viewport

************
Introduction
************

The 3D Viewport is used to interact with the 3D scene for a variety of purposes,
such as modeling, animating, texture painting, etc.


Header Region
=============

.. figure:: /images/editors_3dview_introduction_3d-view-header-object-mode.png

   Object Mode header.

The header contains various menus and controls based on
the current :doc:`mode </editors/3dview/modes>`.
Its items are split into three groups:


Mode & Menus
------------

Mode :kbd:`Ctrl-Tab`
   The 3D Viewport has several :doc:`modes </editors/3dview/modes>`
   used for editing different kinds of data. For example, the default Object Mode
   would let you place a character in the scene, while Pose Mode would allow
   you to pose it.

   The shortcut :kbd:`Ctrl-Tab` brings up a pie menu for quick mode switching.
   If you have an :doc:`Armature </animation/armatures/introduction>` selected,
   it'll instead switch between Object Mode and Pose Mode.

   Pressing :kbd:`Tab` will switch between Object Mode and Edit Mode for objects
   that support it.

View
   This menu offers tools for :doc:`navigating </editors/3dview/navigate/introduction>` in 3D space.

The other menus depend on the current mode, Object Mode menus listed below:

Select
   Contains tools for :ref:`selecting <object-select-menu>` objects.
Add :kbd:`Shift-A`
   Contains a list of different :ref:`objects types <objects-types>` that can be added to the scene.
Object
   Contains tools for operating on :doc:`objects </scene_layout/object/editing/transform/introduction>`,
   such as duplicating them. A subset of these tools can also be accessed by rightclicking
   in the 3D Viewport.


Transform Controls
------------------

Transform Orientation :kbd:`Comma`
   Used to change the :doc:`Transform Orientation </editors/3dview/controls/orientation>`,
   which affects the rotation of the transform gizmo.
Pivot Point :kbd:`Period`
   Used to change the :doc:`Pivot Point </editors/3dview/controls/pivot_point/index>`,
   which affects the location of the transform gizmo.
Snapping :kbd:`Shift-Tab`
   Offers options for :doc:`snapping </editors/3dview/controls/snapping>` items
   to others that are nearby. You can hold :kbd:`Ctrl` to toggle snapping on/off temporarily
   (as long as the key is held).
Proportional Editing :kbd:`O`
   Used to smoothly transform unselected items that are near the selected ones.
   See :doc:`/editors/3dview/controls/proportional_editing`.


Display & Shading
-----------------

Object Type Visibility
   Change which types of objects are visible/selectable in the 3D Viewport.
   See :doc:`Object Type Visibility </editors/3dview/display/visibility>`.
Viewport Gizmos
   Change how :doc:`gizmos </editors/3dview/display/gizmo>` are
   displayed in the 3D Viewport.
Viewport Overlays
   Change how :doc:`overlays </editors/3dview/display/overlays>` are
   displayed in the 3D Viewport.
X-Ray :kbd:`Alt-Z`
   Make the whole scene transparent, allowing you to see and select items that
   would otherwise be occluded.
   This is a shortcut to the X-Ray option inside the
   :ref:`Viewport Shading <3dview-shading-xray>` popover.

   In Pose Mode, this same button controls a different setting with its own separate on/off state.
   Rather than making the scene transparent, it shows the armature in front of any geometry.

Viewport Shading
   Change the :doc:`shading </editors/3dview/display/shading>` of the 3D Viewport.


Toolbar Region
==============

The Toolbar contains tools depending on the current mode
(for example, modeling tools in *Edit Mode*, brush tools in *Sculpt Mode*...).

See :doc:`Tools </editors/3dview/toolbar/index>` for more information.


Sidebar Region
==============

The Sidebar region contains properties of the active object and tool,
as well as of the viewport itself.

See :doc:`Sidebar </editors/3dview/sidebar>` for more information.


## Modes

.. _bpy.ops.object.mode_set:

************
Object Modes
************

.. _fig-view3d-mode-select:

.. figure:: /images/editors_3dview_modes_menu.png
   :align: right

   The Mode select menu.

Modes allow editing different aspects of objects. While Object Mode allows
you to position/rotate/scale them, Edit Mode allows changing their geometry,
Pose Mode allows posing them, and so on.

You can change the current mode using the *Mode* selector in the 3D Viewport header.
Which modes are available depends on the object's type. The complete list
is shown below.

Apart from using the selector, you can also press :kbd:`Ctrl-Tab` to bring up
a pie menu around the cursor for faster access. (If the selected object is an
:doc:`Armature </animation/armatures/introduction>`, this shortcut will instead
switch between Object Mode and Pose Mode.)

Pressing :kbd:`Tab` will toggle Edit Mode for objects that support it.

.. container:: lead

   .. clear

Modes can affect many things in Blender:

- Each mode changes the header and Toolbar to show its own unique set of menus and tools.
  This also means it affects the available keyboard shortcuts.
- Modes can completely change the look of the viewport. For example, Weight Paint mode
  will shade the object to show its vertex weights, which are not normally visible.
- Modes can affect other editors. For example, the :doc:`UV Editor </editors/uv/introduction>`
  can only be used if the 3D Viewport is in Edit Mode. In the
  :doc:`Properties </editors/properties_editor>` editor, too, certain buttons and panels
  can only be used in certain modes.

.. note::

   The cursor becomes a :doc:`brush </sculpt_paint/brush/introduction>`
   in :doc:`Paint and Sculpt Modes </sculpt_paint/index>`.

We will not go into any more detail on mode usages here,
because they are dealt with in their own sections.

.. hint::

   If you are reading this manual and some button or menu option is referenced
   that does not appear on your screen, it may be that you are not in the proper
   mode for that option to be valid.


.. _bpy.ops.object.transfer_mode:

Switching Objects
=================

.. reference::

   :Mode:      All Modes
   :Shortcut:  :kbd:`Alt-Q`

If you enter a mode such as Weight Paint for an object and then select another
object, Blender will typically switch back to Object Mode.
This means that, if you want to weight paint the other object too,
you have to enter the mode a second time.

There is a way of avoiding this, however. Once you enter a mode, the
:doc:`Outliner </editors/outliner/introduction>` will show a dot next
to other objects that also support it. By clicking such a dot, you can
switch over to another object without leaving the mode.

Alternatively, you can hover over the other object in the 3D Viewport
and press :kbd:`Alt-Q`.

.. seealso::

   :ref:`Lock Object Modes <bpy.types.ToolSettings.lock_object_mode>` for
   preventing *accidental* mode changes.


.. _3dview-multi-object-mode:

Multi-Object Editing
====================

Edit Mode and Pose Mode let you work with multiple objects even more
easily than described above, as they can have multiple objects in the mode
at the same time.

There are two ways of accomplishing this:

- If you're not yet in the mode, you can simply select all the objects
  and enter it.
- If you're already in the mode, you can bring other objects into it
  by clicking :kbd:`Ctrl-LMB` on the dot in the Outliner.
  Removing objects from the mode works in the same way.

Some points of note:

- The Properties editor will only ever show the details (shape keys,
  UV maps...) of the active object, not of all the selected ones.
- Selecting any element from an object will make it the active one.
- There are limits to the edits you can make.
  For example, you can't create an edge that connects vertices from
  different objects.


## Selecting

.. _bpy.ops.view3d.select:

*********
Selecting
*********

This page discusses selection tools that are specific to the 3D Viewport.
The generic selection tools are described in the
:doc:`Interface </interface/selecting>` section.

The 3D Viewport has two keys that affect selection:

Select by Origin :kbd:`Ctrl`
   Selects objects by their :doc:`origin </scene_layout/object/origin>`
   rather than their geometry.
Selection Menu :kbd:`Alt`
   Shows a menu in case there are multiple objects under the mouse cursor,
   making it easier to select the one you want.

These keys can be combined to get a selection menu based on object origins.

The mode-specific selection pages are listed below.

Object Mode
===========

- :doc:`Object Mode </scene_layout/object/selecting>`


.. todo add meta selection page.

Edit Mode

of the active object.


Tool
====

Shows settings of the active tool and Workspace.


View
====

View Panel
----------

The *View* panel lets you change other settings regarding the 3D Viewport.

.. _bpy.types.SpaceView3D.lens:

Focal Length
   Control the focal length of the 3D Viewport camera.

.. _bpy.types.SpaceView3D.clip_start:
.. _bpy.types.SpaceView3D.clip_end:

Clip Start/End
   Adjust the minimum and maximum distances for geometry to be visible.
   Geometry closer than *Start* or further away than *End* will not be shown.

   .. note::

      In Orthographic view, the viewport uses negative *End* instead of *Start*.

   .. warning::

      A large clipping range will allow you to see both near and far objects,
      but reduces the depth precision resulting in artifacts.

      In some cases, a very large range may cause operations that depend on the depth buffer to become unreliable,
      although this depends on the graphics card and drivers.

      See :ref:`Troubleshooting Depth Buffer Glitches <troubleshooting-depth>` for more information.

.. _bpy.types.SpaceView3D.use_local_camera:
.. _bpy.types.SpaceView3D.camera:

Local Camera
   Allow this 3D Viewport to have its own :doc:`active camera </editors/3dview/navigate/camera_view>`,
   separate from the global active camera that's defined in the scene.
   The selector next to the checkbox lets you choose this camera.

.. _bpy.types.SpaceView3D.use_render_border:

Render Region
   Use the :ref:`Render Region <editors-3dview-navigate-render-region>`.
   Defining the region with :kbd:`Ctrl-B` will automatically enable this option.

   Note that if you're viewing the scene through the active camera, this option has no effect --
   in this case, you instead need to use the checkbox :menuselection:`Output Properties --> Format --> Render Region`
   in the Properties editor. This will affect not just the viewport, but also the final render.


View Lock
^^^^^^^^^

.. _bpy.types.SpaceView3D.lock_object:

Lock to Object
   Lets you select an object to become the point of interest of the viewpoint.
   The view will then orbit around, and zoom towards, that object.
   This option is not available when viewing the scene through the active camera.

.. _bpy.types.SpaceView3D.lock_cursor:

Lock: To 3D Cursor
   Makes the 3D Cursor the point of interest of the viewpoint.
   This option is only available when *Lock to Object* is not active.

.. _bpy.types.SpaceView3D.lock_camera:

Lock: Camera to View
   When looking through a camera, the camera becomes "glued" to the view
   and will follow it around as you navigate.
   The camera frame will be outlined with a red dashed line.

.. hint::

   If the camera is parented to an object, you can choose to enable
   :ref:`Camera Parent Lock <bpy.types.Object.use_camera_lock_parent>`
   in the camera's properties. This will cause viewport navigation to transform
   the camera's root parent rather than the camera itself.


3D Cursor
---------

Location
   The location of the 3D Cursor.

Rotation
   The rotation of the 3D Cursor.

Rotation Mode
   The rotation mode of the 3D Cursor.


.. _bpy.types.SpaceView3D.use_local_collections:

Collections
-----------

The *Collections* panel shows a list of :doc:`collections </scene_layout/collections/index>`
and can be used to control their visibility.
If a collection contains objects, there is a circle to the left of its name.

Local Collections
   Allows setting collection visibility per viewport rather than globally.

Hide in Viewport (eye icon)
   Shows or hides the collection.

You can also "isolate" a collection by clicking its name. This will show the collection
as well as its ancestors and descendants, and hide all other collections.


Annotations
-----------

See :doc:`Annotations </interface/annotate_tool>` for more information.


## Startup Scene


*************
Startup Scene
*************

After closing the :doc:`splash screen </interface/window_system/splash>`,
the startup scene is displayed in the 3D Viewport (if no other blend-file was loaded).
This startup scene can be :ref:`customized <startup-file>`.

.. figure:: /images/editors_3dview_startup-scene_labels.png

   The startup scene.


Elements
========

Cube
   The gray cube in the center of the scene is a :doc:`mesh </modeling/meshes/index>` object.
   Its orange outline indicates that it's selected.
   The orange dot in the center is its :doc:`Origin </scene_layout/object/origin>`,
   which indicates its precise location.

Light
   The set of concentric black circles is a :doc:`light source </render/lights/light_object>`
   illuminating the cube.

Camera
   The pyramid with a big triangle above it is the :doc:`camera </render/cameras>`,
   which is used as the point of view for rendering.
3D Cursor
   The :doc:`3D cursor </editors/3dview/3d_cursor>`, a cross with a red-and-white circle,
   determines where newly added objects are placed and can also serve as a
   transformation :doc:`pivot point </editors/3dview/controls/pivot_point/index>`.
Grid Floor
   The gray lines forming a floor mark the zero height of the world.
   The red and green lines are the axes of the world coordinate system.
   They meet at the world origin, which is also where the origin of the *Cube* is located.
   The Grid Floor settings are in the :doc:`Viewport Overlays </editors/3dview/display/overlays>` popover.


Text Info
---------

The top left corner of the viewport shows various bits of information --
see :doc:`Viewport Overlays </editors/3dview/display/overlays>` for details.


## Viewport Render


***************
Viewport Render
***************

Viewport rendering lets you create quick preview renders from the current viewpoint
(rather than from the active camera, as would be the case with a regular render).

You can use *Viewport Render* to render both images and animations.

Below is a comparison between the Viewport render and a final render using
the Cycles Renderer.

.. list-table:: Model by © 2016 pokedstudio.com

          :width: 320px

          Full render.

.. note::

   Viewport rendering only works for the Workbench and EEVEE render engines.
   It's not supported for Cycles.

.. tip::

   Disable overlays to get a render without "clutter" like rigs, empties and so on.


Settings
========

For the most part, *Viewport Render* uses the current viewport settings.
Some settings are located in the properties of the render engine
that is used to render the view.

Solid mode uses the render settings of Workbench;
Material Preview mode uses the render settings of EEVEE.

Additionally, some output settings are used too:

- Resolution
- Aspect
- Output path
- File format


Rendering
=========

Activating *Viewport Render* will render from the current active view.
This means that if you are not in an active camera view,
a virtual camera is used to match the current perspective.
To get an image from the camera point of view,
enter the active camera view with :kbd:`Numpad0`.

As with a normal render, you can abort it with :kbd:`Esc`.

.. _bpy.ops.render.opengl:

Render a Still Image
   To render a still image, use :menuselection:`3D Viewport --> View --> Viewport Render Image`.
Render an Animation
   To render an animation, use :menuselection:`3D Viewport --> View --> Viewport Render Animation`.
Render Keyframes
   To render an animation, but only those frames that have a keyframe,
   use :menuselection:`3D Viewport --> View --> Viewport Render Keyframes`.
   This only renders those frames for which the selected objects have an animation key.
   The other frames are still written to the output, but will simply repeat the last-rendered frame.

   For example, when a six-frame animation is rendered, and the selected objects
   have a key on frames 3 and 5, the following frames will be output:

   #. The 1st frame is always rendered.
   #. The 1st frame is repeated because there is no key on this frame.
   #. The 3rd frame is rendered.
   #. The 3rd frame is repeated because there is no key on this frame.
   #. The 5th frame is rendered.
   #. The 5th frame is repeated because there is no key on this frame.

.. tip::

   You can limit the viewport render to a particular region with
   :ref:`Render Regions <editors-3dview-navigate-render-region>`.

   It is toggled between the chosen orientation and
   the global orientation when transformations are made by shortcuts}}.

Transform Orientation
*********************

.. reference::

   :Mode:      Object and Edit Modes
   :Panel:     :menuselection:`Header --> Transform Orientation`
   :Shortcut:  :kbd:`Comma`

The *Transform Orientation* determines the orientation of the
:doc:`Object Gizmo </editors/3dview/display/gizmo>`.
Changing this orientation can make it easier to perform
transformations in the direction you want.

.. figure:: /images/editors_3dview_controls_orientation_demo.png
   :align: center

   With the default Global transform orientation (left) it's tricky to
   move the plane in the direction it's facing, but with Local (right)
   it's easy.

The Transform Orientation can be changed using a
selector in the 3D Viewport's header:

.. figure:: /images/editors_3dview_controls_orientation_menu.png

   Transform Orientation selector.

The orientation can also be changed temporarily while performing
a hotkey-based transformation with
:doc:`axis locking </scene_layout/object/editing/transform/control/axis_locking>`.
For example, if you first press :kbd:`G` to start moving an object,
then :kbd:`X` to lock to the orientation's X axis, and finally :kbd:`X` a second time,
you'll get a lock to an alternative orientation:
the Local orientation if it was Global previously, and the Global orientation
otherwise.

In addition to the builtin orientations,
you can also define your own (see `Custom Orientations`_ below).


.. _bpy.types.TransformOrientationSlot.type:

Orientations
============

Global
   Align the transformation axes to world space.
   The world axes are shown by the :ref:`Navigation Gizmo <navigation-gizmo>`
   in the top right corner of the viewport, as well as the *Grid Floor*.

Local
   Align the transformation axes to the active object's orientation.

Normal
   In Edit Mode, orient the transformation axes so that the Z axis of the gizmo
   matches the average :doc:`Normal </modeling/meshes/editing/mesh/normals>`
   of the selected elements.

   In Object Mode, this is equivalent to *Local* orientation.

Gimbal
   Orient the transformation axes to visualize the workings of the object's
   :ref:`Rotation Mode <bpy.types.Object.rotation_mode>`.
   This is specifically useful for the Euler modes,
   where the object is rotated one axis at a time: the rotation axes don't
   stay perpendicular to each other and might even overlap, a phenomenon
   known as :term:`gimbal lock` that complicates animation.

View
   Align the transformation axes to the view (meaning they change as you orbit around):

   - X: Left/Right
   - Y: Up/Down
   - Z: Towards/Away from the screen

Cursor
   Align the transformation axes to the :doc:`3D Cursor </editors/3dview/3d_cursor>`.

Parent
   Align the transformation axes to the :doc:`Parent </scene_layout/object/editing/parent>`.

Custom Orientations
-------------------

.. reference::

   :Mode:      Object and Edit Modes
   :Panel:     :menuselection:`Header --> Transform Orientation`

You can define custom transform orientations using objects or mesh elements.
Custom orientations defined from an object use the *Local* orientation of that object,
whereas those defined from mesh elements (vertices, edges, faces)
use the average *Normal* orientation of those elements.

.. figure:: /images/editors_3dview_controls_orientation_custom.png

   Transform Orientation panel.

The *Transform Orientation* panel, found in the header of the 3D Viewport,
can be used to select, add, remove, and rename transform orientations.

The default name for these orientations is derived from the selection.
If it's an object it will take that object's name,
if it's an edge it will be titled "Edge", and so on.


.. _bpy.ops.transform.create_orientation:

Create Orientation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To create a custom orientation, select an object or mesh element(s) and
click the "+" button in the *Transform Orientation* panel.

.. figure:: /images/editors_3dview_controls_orientation_custom-name.png

   Create Orientation :ref:`bpy.ops.screen.redo_last` panel.

Right after creating the orientation,
the *Create Orientation* :ref:`bpy.ops.screen.redo_last` panel gives a few options:

Name
   Text field for naming the new orientation.
Use View
   The new orientation will be aligned to the view space.
Use After Creation
   The new orientation stays selected.
Overwrite Previous
   If the new orientation is given an existing name, a suffix will be added
   to it's name to avoid overwriting the existing orientation,
   unless *Overwrite Previous* is checked, in which case it will be overwritten.


Delete Orientation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To delete a custom orientation, simply select it and click the × button.


## Proportional Editing

Proportional Editing
********************

.. reference::

   :Mode:      Object and Edit Mode
   :Header:    |prop-edit-icon| :menuselection:`Proportional Editing`
   :Shortcut:  :kbd:`O`

.. figure:: /images/editors_3dview_controls_proportional-editing_tool.png
   :align: right
   :width: 250px

   Proportional Editing popover.

Proportional Editing is a way of transforming selected elements while also affecting
the nearby unselected elements. The farther away an unselected element is, the less it will be affected
(hence the "proportional"). This feature is very useful for smoothly deforming dense meshes.

.. note::

   Blender also has a :ref:`painting-sculpting-index` workflow
   that contains brushes and tools for proportionally editing a mesh without seeing the individual vertices.


Controls
========

Disable :kbd:`O`
   Proportional Editing is off, only selected vertices will be affected.
Enable :kbd:`O`
   Vertices other than the selected vertex are affected, within a defined radius.


.. _bpy.types.ToolSettings.proportional_distance:

Proportional Size
-----------------

You can increase or decrease the radius of the tool's influence during a transform operation
from the Proportional Editing popover or with :kbd:`WheelUp`/:kbd:`WheelDown`, or :kbd:`PageUp`/:kbd:`PageDown`
respectively. As you change the radius, the points surrounding your selection will adjust their positions
accordingly.

While editing, you can change the curve profile by either clicking the *Falloff* icon in the header
or pressing :kbd:`Shift-O` to get a pie menu.

Object Mode
===========

Proportional Editing is typically used in *Edit Mode*, but it can also be used in *Object Mode*.
The tool then works on entire objects rather than individual mesh components.

In the image below, the leftmost cylinder is being scaled up vertically,
which also affects the cylinders near it.

.. figure:: /images/editors_3dview_controls_proportional-editing_object-mode.png
   :width: 50%
   :align: center

   Proportional Editing in Object Mode.


Edit Mode
=========

When working with dense geometry, it can become difficult to make subtle adjustments
without causing visible lumps and creases in the model's surface.
When you face situations like this, Proportional Editing can help.

.. figure:: /images/editors_3dview_controls_proportional-editing_mode.png
   :align: center

   Proportional Editing in Edit Mode.


Options
-------

.. _bpy.types.ToolSettings.use_proportional_connected:

Connected Only :kbd:`Alt-O`
   Rather than using a radius only, the proportional falloff spreads via connected geometry.
   This means that you can proportionally edit the vertices in a finger of a hand
   without affecting the other fingers. While the other vertices are physically close (in 3D space),
   they are far away following the topological edge connections of the mesh.
   The icon will have a blue center when *Connected* is active.
   This mode is only available in *Edit Mode*.

.. _bpy.types.ToolSettings.use_proportional_projected:

Projected from View
   Depth along the view is ignored when applying the radius.

   .. figure:: /images/editors_3dview_controls_proportional-editing_2d-compare.png

      The difference between having "Projected from View" disabled (left) and enabled (right).


Example
=======

obtained by moving up the vertices of a triangulated grid
with *Proportional Editing* enabled.

Snapping lets you easily align objects and mesh elements to others.
It can be toggled by clicking the magnet icon in the 3D Viewport's header,
or more temporarily by holding :kbd:`Ctrl`.

.. container:: lead

   .. clear

Snap Base
=========

.. reference::

   :Mode:      Object, Edit, and Pose Mode
   :Header:    :menuselection:`Snapping --> Snap Base`
   :Shortcut:  :kbd:`Shift-Ctrl-Tab`

Determines which point in the geometry is the snap base that will snap to the target.

:Active:
   Snaps using the origin (in Object Mode) or center (in Edit Mode) of the active element.
:Median:
   Snaps using the median of the selection.
:Center:
   Snaps using the current transformation center
   (another word for the :doc:`pivot point </editors/3dview/controls/pivot_point/index>`).
   This option is especially useful in combination with the
   :doc:`3D Cursor </editors/3dview/3d_cursor>` for choosing the snapping
   point completely manually.
:Closest:
   Snaps using the vertex that's closest to the target.

.. list-table::

   * - .. figure:: /images/editors_3dview_controls_snapping_target-closest.png

          Closest.

     - .. figure:: /images/editors_3dview_controls_snapping_target-median.png

          Median.


.. _bpy.types.ToolSettings.snap_elements_base:

Snap Target
===========

.. reference::

   :Mode:      Object, Edit, and Pose Mode
   :Header:    :menuselection:`Snapping --> Snap Target`
   :Shortcut:  :kbd:`Shift-Ctrl-Tab`

Determines the target which the selection will be snapped to.

:Increment:
   Snaps to grid points. When in Orthographic view, the snapping increment changes depending on the zoom level.

   This option snaps to an imaginary grid that starts at the selection's original location and has the same
   resolution as the viewport grid. In other words, it lets you move the selection in "increments" of the
   grid cell size.
:Grid:
   Snaps to the grid that's displayed in the viewport.
:Vertex:
   Snaps to the vertex that's closest to the mouse cursor.
:Edge:
   Snaps to the edge that's closest to the mouse cursor.
:Volume:
   Snaps the selection to a depth that's centered *inside* the object under the cursor.
   This is useful for positioning an :doc:`Armature </animation/armatures/introduction>`
   bone so it's centered inside a character's arm, for example; the other snapping options
   would place it on the arm's surface instead.

   While Blender also has :doc:`Volume objects </modeling/volumes/introduction>`, this option
   is not related to those.
:Edge Center:
   Snaps to the centerpoint of the edge that's closest to the mouse cursor.
:Edge Perpendicular:
   Snaps to a specific point on the edge so that the line from the selection's original location
   (indicated by a white cross) to its new location is perpendicular to that edge.

.. tip::

   Multiple snapping modes can be enabled at once using :kbd:`Shift-LMB`.

Snap Target for Individual Elements
===================================

.. reference::

   :Mode:      Object, Edit, and Pose Mode
   :Header:    :menuselection:`Snapping --> Snap Target for Individual Elements`
   :Shortcut:  :kbd:`Shift-Ctrl-Tab`

Type of element for individual transformed elements to snap to.

:Face Project:
   Snaps to the face that's under the mouse cursor.
   This can be used for bending a flat sheet so it snugly fits against a curved surface, for example.

   This works similar to the :doc:`/modeling/modifiers/deform/shrinkwrap`.
:Face Nearest:
   Individually snaps each object (in Object Mode) or vertex (in Edit Mode) to the face that's closest
   to its new location. This makes it possible to snap to occluded geometry.


Target Selection
================

Sets more detailed snapping options. The available options depend on the mode
(Object/Edit) as well as the :ref:`Snap Target <bpy.types.ToolSettings.snap_elements_base>`.

.. _bpy.types.ToolSettings.use_snap_self:

Include Active :guilabel:`Edit Mode`
   Snap to other mesh elements of the active object.

   This checkbox is ignored if
   :doc:`Proportional Editing </editors/3dview/controls/proportional_editing>`
   is enabled.

.. _bpy.types.ToolSettings.use_snap_edit:

Include Edited :guilabel:`Edit Mode`
   Snap to other objects that are also in Edit Mode.

.. _bpy.types.ToolSettings.use_snap_nonedit:

Include Non-Edited :guilabel:`Edit Mode`
   Snap to other objects that are not in Edit Mode.

.. _bpy.types.ToolSettings.use_snap_selectable:

Exclude Non-Selectable
   Snap only to objects that are selectable.

.. _bpy.types.ToolSettings.use_snap_align_rotation:

Align Rotation to Target
   Rotates the selection so that its Z axis gets aligned to the normal of the target.

.. _bpy.types.ToolSettings.use_snap_backface_culling:

Backface Culling
   Exclude back-facing geometry from snapping.

.. _bpy.types.ToolSettings.use_snap_to_same_target:

Snap to Same Target :guilabel:`Face Nearest`
   Snap only to the object which the selection was nearest to before starting
   the transformation.

.. _bpy.types.ToolSettings.snap_face_nearest_steps:

Face Nearest Steps :guilabel:`Face Nearest` :guilabel:`Edit Mode`
   Breaks the overall transformation into multiple steps, performing a snap each time.
   This can give better results in certain cases.

.. _bpy.types.ToolSettings.use_snap_peel_object:

Snap Peel Object :guilabel:`Volume`
   If the target object is composed of several disconnected mesh islands that
   intersect each other, "Snap To Volume" will normally snap to the island which the
   mouse is hovering over, ignoring the other islands. By enabling "Snap Peel Object,"
   you can instead treat the target object as one connected whole.

   :Shortcut:  :kbd:`Period`

Places the pivot point at the active element, which is the element that was selected most recently.


In Object Mode
==============

When in Object Mode,
rotation and scaling happen around the origin of the active object,
which is the element with a lighter outline than the others.

The effect of the pivot point is shown in the image below, where the active object (the cube)
remains in the same location while the others move.

.. figure:: /images/editors_3dview_controls_pivot-point_active-element_object-mode-rotation.png
   :align: center

   Starting point, rotation, and scaling.


In Edit Mode
============

When in Edit Mode, rotation and scaling happen around the centerpoint of
the active element, which is the element with a white outline.
That centerpoint remains in the same location while everything else
is transformed around it.

The image below illustrates rotation around the active vertex,
edge, and face. Each time, the active element rotates in place,
while the others "orbit" around it. In the case of vertices,
the active vertex is not changed at all, as a vertex on its own
is just a point that has no concept of rotation.

Bounding Box Center

   :Mode:      Object Mode and Edit Mode
   :Header:    |pivot-icon| :menuselection:`Pivot Point --> Bounding Box Center`
   :Shortcut:  :kbd:`Period`

In this mode, the pivot point lies at the center of the bounding box, which is a box that's
wrapped as tightly as possible around the selection while still being aligned to the world axes.


In Object Mode
==============

The pivot point becomes the center of the bounding box *around the selected objects'
origin points*, not their geometry.

This means that, if you have a single object selected, the pivot point is the same
as the object's :doc:`origin point </scene_layout/object/origin>` -- which can be customized
and doesn't have to be in the center. In the example below, the orange rectangle
has it in a corner instead.

.. figure:: /images/editors_3dview_controls_pivot-point_bounding-box-center_object-mode_single.png
   :align: center

   Single object rotation.

If you have multiple objects selected, the pivot point becomes the center
of an imaginary box around their origins.

The image below shows the difference between Bounding Box Center
and :doc:`/editors/3dview/controls/pivot_point/median_point`.
The latter calculates the average position of the origins,
meaning that the pivot point shifts towards the area with the most objects.

   :Shortcut:  :kbd:`Period`

While the other pivot point modes transform the whole selection around one point,
Individual Origins transforms each item around itself.

In Object Mode
==============

Each object gets transformed around its :doc:`origin </scene_layout/object/origin>`,
which is a point that can be chosen freely and doesn't have to be in the center.
In the example below, the orange rectangle has it in a corner instead.

.. figure:: /images/editors_3dview_controls_pivot-point_individual-origins_rotation-around-center.png
   :align: center

   Rotation around individual origins.

The images below compare Individual Origins to :doc:`/editors/3dview/controls/pivot_point/median_point`.


.. figure:: /images/editors_3dview_controls_pivot-point_individual-origins_objects-rotate.png
   :align: center

   Starting situation, rotation around Individual Origins, rotation around Median Point.

.. figure:: /images/editors_3dview_controls_pivot-point_individual-origins_objects-scale.png
   :align: center

   Starting situation, scaling using Individual Origins, scaling using Median Point.


In Edit Mode
============

Each selected element is transformed around its own centerpoint.

.. figure:: /images/editors_3dview_controls_pivot-point_individual-origins_rotation-faces.png
   :align: center

   Starting situation, rotation around Individual Origins, rotation around Median Point.

.. figure:: /images/editors_3dview_controls_pivot-point_individual-origins_scale-individual-faces.png
   :align: center

   Starting situation, scaling using Individual Origins, scaling using Median Point.

When you transform adjacent faces or edges, they are treated as a single element
(meaning they don't become disconnected).


## Median Point

.. |pivot-icon| image:: /images/editors_3dview_controls_pivot-point_menu.png

************
Median Point

   :Mode:      Object Mode and Edit Mode
   :Header:    |pivot-icon| :menuselection:`Pivot Point --> Median Point`
   :Shortcut:  :kbd:`Period`

Places the pivot point at the averaged-out position of the selected items.


In Object Mode
==============

In Object Mode, the Median Point is the averaged-out position of the
:doc:`origins </scene_layout/object/origin>` of the selected objects.
The shape and size of the objects is not taken into account.

Origins can be chosen freely and can even lie outside their object's
geometry, so that the Median Point is not always what you might expect.

.. figure:: /images/editors_3dview_controls_pivot-point_median-point_object-mode.png
   :align: center

   Median points in Object Mode.


In Edit Mode
============

In Edit Mode, the Median Point is the averaged-out position of the
selected vertices. This means that the pivot point will shift towards
the area with the densest geometry.

In the example below, the pivot point lies perfectly in the middle
if both cubes have the same number of vertices, but heavily leans towards
the side if one cube is subdivided -- even though both cubes still
have the same size.

Viewport Gizmos
***************

.. reference::

   :Mode:      All Modes
   :Header:    |gizmo-icon| :menuselection:`Gizmos`

Clicking the icon toggles all gizmos in the 3D Viewport.
The drop-down button displays a popover with more detailed settings,
which are described below.


Viewport Gizmos
===============

Navigate
   Enable/disable the :ref:`navigation gizmo <navigation-gizmo>`.
Active Tool
   Enable/disable the gizmo of the active tool.
Active Object
   Enable/disable the Object Gizmos for the active element (see below).


Object Gizmos
=============

Object Gizmos allow mouse-controlled translation, rotation and scaling in the 3D Viewport.
While they're called "object" gizmos in the popover, they also apply to other transformable
elements such as mesh vertices.

There is a separate gizmo for each operation.
Each gizmo can be used separately or in combination with the others.

A gizmo always has three color-coded axes: X (red), Y (green), and Z (blue).
You can drag an axis with :kbd:`LMB` to transform along it. The Move and Scale gizmos
additionally have small colored squares for transforming along two axes in one go.

Various modifier keys can be used:

- Holding :kbd:`Ctrl` at any time will toggle :doc:`snapping </editors/3dview/controls/snapping>`
  and also make rotation and scaling work in coarse increments.
- Holding :kbd:`Shift` *after* pressing :kbd:`LMB` will do the opposite of the above, "slowing down"
  the transformation relative to mouse movement to allow finer adjustments.
- Holding :kbd:`Shift` *before* pressing :kbd:`LMB` will perform the transformation in the plane
  that's perpendicular to the clicked axis. See :ref:`view3d-transform-plane-lock`.

The Gizmos popover has the following settings for object gizmos:

Orientation
   The orientation to use for the gizmo. *Default* means to use the viewport's
   :doc:`Transform Orientation </editors/3dview/controls/orientation>`.
   The other options override it.
Move
   Show the gizmo to control the location.
   Dragging the small white circle allows free movement in the viewing plane.
Rotate
   Show the gizmo to control the rotation.
   Dragging the large white circle allows rotation around the viewing direction.
   Dragging the translucent white disc within that circle (only visible when
   hovering over the gizmo) allows :ref:`trackball rotation <view3d-transform-trackball>`.
Scale
   Show the gizmo to control the scale.
   Dragging the area between the small and large white circles scales along all three axes.

The latter three options are also available in a pie menu
if you have the *Grave Accent / Tilde Action* in the
:doc:`Keymap Preferences </editors/preferences/keymap>` set to *Gizmos*.

.. note::

   If you're using a tool that's tied to a particular gizmo setup (the *Move*, *Rotate*,
   *Scale* and *Transform* tools), the Move/Rotate/Scale checkboxes won't have any effect.

Viewport Overlays
*****************

.. reference::

   :Mode:      All Modes
   :Header:    |overlays-icon| :menuselection:`Overlays`

Clicking the icon toggles all overlays in the 3D Viewport.
The drop-down button displays a popover with more detailed settings,
which are described below.

Depending on the current :doc:`object interaction mode </editors/3dview/modes>`,
there may be a second button with yet more settings,
which are also described here.


General
=======

The following options are always present, independent of the current mode.
Some of the overlays can be customized in the
:doc:`Viewport Preferences </editors/preferences/viewport>`.


Guides
------

Grid
   Show grid in orthographic side view.
Floor
   Show the ground plane in perspective view.
Axes
   Show the X, Y and/or Z axis lines.

Scale
   The distance between lines in the grid/floor.
Subdivisions
   The number of subdivisions between grid lines.

Text Info
   Show various bits of information in the top left corner of the viewport.

   - **View Perspective** --
     Name of the :doc:`View Perspective </editors/3dview/navigate/projections>`,
     such as "Top Orthographic" or "User Perspective."
   - **Playback Frame Rate (FPS)** --
     Displays the Frames Per Second at which the animation is playing.
     By default, Blender goes through every single frame, which may result in an FPS that's lower than
     intended (and the animation playing slower than realtime); the FPS turns red in this case.
     You can change this behavior in the Playback popover of the :doc:`Timeline </editors/timeline>`.
   - **Object Info** --
     Shows the current frame in parentheses, followed by the names of the selected
     :doc:`Collection </scene_layout/collections/index>` and the :ref:`active object <object-active>`.
     When applicable, also shows the selected :doc:`Shape Key </animation/shape_keys/introduction>`
     and (in angle brackets) the :doc:`Marker </animation/markers>` on the current frame.
     If the object has a keyframe on the current frame, the Object Info is displayed in yellow.
   - **Grid Resolution** --
     When the view is aligned to a world axis (see :doc:`/editors/3dview/navigate/viewpoint`),
     the Text Info additionally shows the smallest distance between two parallel grid lines.

Statistics
   Show information about the amount of objects and geometry.
   Note that the counters depend on the current selection.
   For example, selecting a mesh gives info on the number of vertices, edges, and faces,
   while selecting a light shows the number of lights in the scene.

   - **Objects** -- Number of the selected objects and the total count.
   - **Geometry** -- Displays information about the current scene depending on the mode and object type.
     This can be the number of vertices, faces, triangles, or bones.

HDRI Preview
   Show two spheres, one glossy and one diffuse, to preview the HDRI that's being used for world lighting.
   While HDRIs can be used in both the *Material Preview* and *Rendered*
   :doc:`shading modes </editors/3dview/display/shading>`, the HDRI Preview overlay
   is only available in the former.
3D Cursor
   Show the :doc:`3D Cursor </editors/3dview/3d_cursor>`.
Annotations
   Show :doc:`annotations </interface/annotate_tool>`.


Objects
-------

Extras
   Show objects that don't have geometry (such as empties, cameras and lights).

.. _bpy.types.View3DOverlay.show_light_colors:

Light Colors
   Shades the outline of light objects to the color the light produces.

.. _bpy.types.View3DOverlay.show_relationship_lines:

Relationship Lines
   Show dashed lines indicating parent or constraint relationships.
Outline Selected
   Show an outline around selected objects.

   Show the :doc:`motion path </animation/motion_paths>` overlay.
Origin
   Show the :doc:`origins </scene_layout/object/origin>` of the selected objects.
Origin (All)
   Show the origins of all objects.

.. _bpy.types.View3DOverlay.bone_wire_alpha:

Bone Wireframe Opacity
   The maximum opacity used for bones drawn in the *Wireframe*
   :doc:`shading mode </editors/3dview/display/shading>` (or in *Solid* shading mode with X-Ray active).
   This is helpful when it is necessary to reduce clutter and focus on the mesh rather than bones.


Geometry
--------

.. _bpy.types.View3DOverlay.wireframe_threshold:
.. _bpy.types.View3DOverlay.show_wireframes:

Wireframe
   Display mesh edges. Similar to :ref:`Wireframe Shading <3dview-shading-rendered>`,
   but displays edges on top of existing shading.
   The value slider adjusts which edges to display:
   lower values hide edges on surfaces that are almost flat, while a value of 1 shows all edges.

   .. _bpy.types.View3DOverlay.wireframe_opacity:

   Opacity
      The opacity of the displayed edges, from 0 (invisible) to 1 (fully opaque).

.. _bpy.types.View3DOverlay.fade_inactive_alpha:
.. _bpy.types.View3DOverlay.show_fade_inactive:

Fade Inactive Geometry
   In modes other than Object Mode, fade out objects that you're not working on.
   The slider controls how much they're faded out.

.. _bpy.types.View3DOverlay.show_face_orientation:

Face Orientation
   Show faces whose normal is pointing towards the camera in blue,
   and faces whose normal is pointing away from the camera in red.
   This lets you quickly check for faces that are oriented incorrectly:
   the outside surface of an object should typically be all blue.


.. _3dview-overlays-view_node:

Viewer Node
-----------

Visualizes :doc:`/modeling/geometry_nodes/attributes_reference`
connected to the :doc:`/modeling/geometry_nodes/output/viewer`.

=======================

The following options are available when in Mesh Edit Mode.

Faces
   Highlight selected faces. Affects all selection modes.
Center
   Show face center points in solid shading modes. (They're always shown in wireframe shading mode.)

   Only affects face selection mode.
Creases
   Display edges marked with a crease
   for the :doc:`Subdivision Surface Modifier </modeling/modifiers/generate/subdivision_surface>`.
Sharp
   Display sharp edges, used with the :doc:`Edge Split modifier </modeling/modifiers/generate/edge_split>`.

      This helps to identify areas with very low weights that have been painted onto.

      :None: Vertices are displayed in the usual way.
      :Active: Vertices are shown in black if they have no weight in the active vertex group.
      :All: Vertices are shown in black if they have no weight in any vertex group.


Mesh Analysis
-------------

Show the :ref:`modeling-mesh-analysis` overlay.

   Show the length of selected edges.
Edge Angle
   Show the angle of selected edges between two faces.
Face Area
   Show the area of selected faces.
Face Angle
   Show the angle of selected face corners.

.. tip::

   Geometry connected to the selection is shown while transforming,
   allowing you to move a vertex and see the connected edge lengths for example.

.. note::

   These values respect the :ref:`Transform Space <modeling-mesh-transform-panel>`
   in the Sidebar. Use *Global* if you want the object's scale to be applied to the measurements.


.. seealso::

   The :doc:`Measure </editors/3dview/toolbar/measure>` tool for measuring
   arbitrary distances and angles.


.. _mesh-display-normals:

.. _bpy.types.View3DOverlay.vertex_paint_mode_opacity:

Stencil Mask Opacity
   Does nothing. (Stencil masks are only available for texture painting.)
Show Wire
   Display mesh edges in white (unlike the *Wireframe* overlay which shows them in black).


Weight Paint Overlays
=====================

Opacity
   The opacity of the overlay.
Zero Weights
   Display unreferenced and zero-weighted areas in black.
   This helps to identify areas with very low weights that have been painted onto.

   :None: Vertices are displayed in the usual way.
   :Active: Vertices are shown in black if they have no weight in the active vertex group.
   :All: Vertices are shown in black if they have no weight in any vertex group.

   ghosts of the selected keyframes are shown instead.
   See :doc:`/grease_pencil/properties/onion_skinning`.
Canvas
   Display a grid over the Grease Pencil drawing plane.
   The opacity of the grid can be controlled with the slider.
   When using the *Canvas X-Ray* option, objects are drawn behind the canvas grid.
Fade Inactive Layers
   Decrease the opacity of all the layers in the object other than the active one.
   The opacity factor can be controlled with the slider.
Fade Inactive Objects
   Cover all of the viewport except the active Grease Pencil object with a full color layer to improve visibility
   while drawing over complex scenes.

   Fade Grease Pencil Objects
      Include or exclude Grease Pencil objects.

Edit Lines
   Show edit lines in Edit Mode.
Only in Multiframe
   When Multiframe is enabled and keyframes other than the current frame are selected,
   strokes on those keyframes are displayed as just their edit lines -- the strokes themselves are hidden.
   Note that this does not affect Onion Skinning.
Stroke Direction
   Toggle the display of the selected strokes' start points (green) and end points (red) to visualize their direction.
Material Name
   Show material name next to the selected strokes.
Vertex Opacity
   Opacity for vertices (points) and edit lines in Edit and Sculpt Mode.
Vertex Paint Opacity
   The opacity of the vertex color overlay in Vertex Paint Mode and Draw Mode.
   Note that in Draw Mode, vertex paint is only visible in the *Material Preview*
   and *Rendered* shading modes by default. To see it in *Solid* mode, you either
   need to use Vertex Paint Mode, or set the :doc:`Color </render/workbench/color>`
   shading setting to *Attribute*.

.. _bpy.types.View3DOverlay.display_handle:

Handles
   When :doc:`Curve Editing </grease_pencil/modes/edit/curve_editing>` is active,
   this option controls how curves are displayed in the 3D Viewport.

   :None: No handles are displayed, only the control points.
   :Selected: Only handles for selected control points are displayed.
   :All: All the handles are displayed.


## Shading

.. |shading-icon| image:: /images/editors_3dview_display_shading.png
.. _bpy.types.View3DShading.type:
.. _view3d-viewport-shading:

Viewport Shading
****************

.. reference::

   :Mode:      All Modes
   :Header:    |shading-icon| :menuselection:`Viewport Shading`
   :Shortcut:  :kbd:`Z` :kbd:`Shift-Z`

Blender offers different shading modes for helping with different tasks.
For example, Solid shading is well-suited for modeling, while Rendered
is useful for setting up lighting.

The radio buttons let you change the shading mode, while the drop-down button
opens a popover with additional options described below.

Pressing :kbd:`Z` opens a pie menu for changing the shading mode.
Pressing :kbd:`Shift-Z` switches between the current shading mode and Wireframe.

.. _bpy.types.View3DShading.wireframe_color_type:

Wire Color
   How wireframes are colored. This affects the Wireframe shading mode and overlay.

   :Theme:
      Use the *Active Object*, *Wire*, or *Wire Edit* :doc:`theme color </editors/preferences/themes>`
      based on the object's current state.
   :Object:
      Use the color from the object's
      :ref:`Viewport Display <properties-object-viewport-display>` settings.
   :Random:
      Each object gets displayed in a random color.


.. _3dview-shading-rendered:

Wireframe
=========

Only displays the edges (wireframes) of the objects in the scene.

.. _bpy.types.View3DShading.background_type:

Background
   How the background is displayed in the 3D Viewport.

   :Theme:
      Use the background of the theme. This can be configured in the
      :doc:`Themes Preferences </editors/preferences/themes>`
      under :menuselection:`3D Viewport --> Theme Space --> Gradient Colors`.
   :World:
      Use the color from the :doc:`World </render/lights/world>`'s Viewport Display options.
   :Viewport:
      Select a custom color for the background of the 3D Viewport.

Options
   .. _3dview-shading-xray:

   X-Ray :kbd:`Alt-Z`
      Make objects transparent, allowing you to see and select
      items that would otherwise be occluded. The slider controls
      object opacity.

   Outline
      Draw an outline around objects. The color of the outline can be adjusted.


.. _3dview-shading-solid:

Solid
=====

This mode utilizes the :doc:`Workbench Render Engine </render/workbench/introduction>` to render the 3D Viewport.
It shows solid geometry but uses simplified shading and lighting without the use of shader nodes.
Solid mode is good for modeling and sculpting, and is really useful with the multitude of
options to emphasize certain geometric features.

Lighting
   How lights are computed.

   :Flat:
      Do not calculate any lighting. The base color of the scene will be rendered.
   :Studio:
      Use studio lights to light the objects.
      The studio lights can be :ref:`configured in the preferences <prefs-lights-studio>`.
      Studio lights can follow the camera or be fixed. When fixed the angle of the lights can be adjusted.

      World Space Lighting
         Uses world space lighting so lights do not follow the view camera.
      Rotation
         The rotation of the studio lights on the Z axis.
   :MatCap:
      Use a material capture to light the objects in the scene.
      MatCaps can be flipped horizontally by clicking the Flip MatCap button.

      Custom MatCaps can be :ref:`loaded in the preferences <prefs-lights-matcaps>`.

.. _viewport_shading_solid_color:

Color
   The source to compute the color for objects in the viewport.

   :Material:
      Use the color that can be set per material
      in the Viewport Display :ref:`properties-material-viewport-display` panel.
   :Object:
      Use the color that can be set per object
      in the Viewport Display :ref:`properties-object-viewport-display` panel.
   :Attribute:
      Display the active :ref:`Color Attribute <modeling-meshes-properties-object_data-color-attributes>`
      of an object. When an object has no active Color Attribute it will be rendered in the color set
      in the Viewport Display :ref:`properties-object-viewport-display` panel.
   :Single:
      Render the whole scene using a single color. The color can be chosen.
   :Random:
      A random color will be selected for every object in the scene.
   :Texture:
      Show the texture from the active image texture node using the active UV map coordinates
      When an object has no active texture the object will be rendered with the settings
      in the Viewport Display :ref:`properties-material-viewport-display` panel.

Background
   How the background is displayed in the 3D Viewport.

   :Theme:
      Use the background of the theme. This can be configured in the
      :doc:`Themes Preferences </editors/preferences/themes>`
      under :menuselection:`3D Viewport --> Theme Space --> Gradient Colors`.
   :World:
      Use the color from the :doc:`World </render/lights/world>`'s Viewport Display options.
   :Viewport:
      Select a custom color for the background of the 3D Viewport.


Options
-------

Backface Culling
   Use backface culling to hide backsides of faces.

X-Ray
   Render the scene transparent. With the slider you can control how
   transparent the scene should appear.

Shadow
   Renders a sharp shadow in the scene.

   Darkness
      Defines how dark the shadow should be rendered. This slider can be adjusted
      between 0 (shadow not visible) and 1 (shadow is black).

   Light Direction
      Controls the direction of the light source that casts the shadows.

   Shadow Shift
      Controls the Shadow termination angle. It can be used to limit self shadowing artifacts.

   Shadow Focus
      Controls the falloff near the edge of the shadow.

Cavity
   Highlight ridges and valleys in the scene geometry.

   Type
      Method how to calculate the cavity.

      :World: More precise but is slower to calculate.
      :Screen: Fast but does not take the size of the ridges and valleys into account.
      :Both: Both will use both methods.

   Ridge
      Control the visibility of ridges.

   Valley
      Control the visibility of valleys.

Depth of Field
   Use the Depth of Field settings of the active camera in the viewport.
   Only visible when looking through the camera.

   The settings are located on :menuselection:`Properties --> Camera --> Depth of Field` panel.

Outline
   Render the outline of objects in the viewport. The color of the outline can be adjusted.

Specular Highlighting
   Render specular highlights.

   .. note::

      Only available when Lighting is set to *Studio* lighting or when a MatCap
      has been selected that contains a specular pass.


.. _3dview-material-preview:

Material Preview
================

Render the 3D Viewport with :doc:`EEVEE </render/eevee/introduction>` and an HDRI environment.
This mode is particularly suited for previewing materials and painting textures.
You can select different lighting conditions to test your materials.

.. note::

   The Material Preview shading mode is not available when the scene's render engine
   is set to :doc:`Workbench </render/workbench/introduction>`.

Lighting
   Scene Lights
      Use the lights in the scene. When disabled (or when the scene contains no lights),
      a virtual light is used instead.

..  _bpy.types.View3DShading.use_scene_world:

   Scene World
      Use the World of the scene.
      When disabled, a world will be constructed with the following options:

      HDRI Environment
         The environment map used to light the scene.
      Rotation
         The rotation of the environment on the Z axis.

         World Space Lighting
            Makes the lighting rotation fixed and not follow the camera.

      Strength
         Light intensity of the environment.
      World Opacity
         Opacity of the HDRI as a background image in the viewport.
      Blur
         Factor to unfocus the HDRI.
         Note that this does not change the diffusion of the lighting,
         only the appearance of the background.

Render Pass
   Instead of the combined render, show a specific
   :doc:`render pass </render/layers/passes>`.
   Useful to analyze and debug geometry, materials and lighting.

.. _viewport-compositing:

Compositor
   Controls the enablement of the compositor in the viewport. If enabled, the scene compositor node
   tree will be evaluated using the :ref:`GPU Compositor <realtime-compositor>` and the output
   will be displayed directly in the viewport.

   :Disabled: Always disabled.
   :Camera: Enabled only in camera view.
   :Always: Always enabled regardless of the view.

.. tip::

   Since it might be difficult to control the look of the viewport compositor due to changes in the
   aspect ratio, pan, and zoom of the viewport, one can limit the compositing space to the camera
   region by changing to :doc:`Camera View </editors/3dview/navigate/camera_view>`, which should
   make the results better match the final render.


.. _3dview-rendered:

Rendered
========

Render the 3D Viewport using the scene's *Render Engine*, for interactive rendering.
This gives you a preview of the final result, including scene lighting effects.

The options are the same as for *Material Preview*, except that
the *Render Pass* selector will offer different passes if the scene
uses the :doc:`Cycles </render/cycles/introduction>` render engine.


## Visibility

.. _bpy.types.SpaceView3D.show_object_viewport:
.. _bpy.types.SpaceView3D.show_object_select:

.. |visibility-icon| image:: /images/editors_3dview_display_visibility.png

**********************
Object Type Visibility
**********************

.. reference::

   :Mode:      All Modes
   :Header:    |visibility-icon| :menuselection:`View Object Types`

This popover lets you control the visibility and selectability of the various object types.
For example, you can hide all the Lights in the scene with one click.

The settings only apply to the current 3D Viewport. Object types marked as unselectable
can still be selected in other viewports and in the
:doc:`Outliner </editors/outliner/introduction>`, for example.

.. seealso::

   Outliner :ref:`Restriction Columns <editors-outliner-interface-restriction_columns>`
   for making individual objects invisible or unselectable across all viewports.


## Align


********
Aligning
********

.. reference::

   :Menu:      :menuselection:`View --> Align View`

These options allow you to align and orient the view.

Align View to Active
   Aligns the view to a certain local axis of the active object, bone, or (in Edit Mode)
   the normal of the active face. The view also becomes orthographic.

   To return to the regular (untilted) perspective view, you can first press :kbd:`Numpad3`
   to align to the global X axis, then orbit with :kbd:`MMB`.

Align Active Camera to View :kbd:`Ctrl-Alt-Numpad0`
   Moves and rotates the active camera so it matches the current viewpoint.

Align Active Camera to Selected
   Moves the active camera (without changing its orientation) so that its view
   frames the selected objects.

Center Cursor and Frame All :kbd:`Shift-C`
   Moves the :doc:`3D Cursor </editors/3dview/3d_cursor>` back to the world origin
   and changes the view so that you can see everything in your scene.

Center View to Cursor
   Centers the view on the 3D Cursor.

View Lock to Active
   Centers the view on the active object and makes it the point of interest. The view
   will continue orbiting around it even if you pan to a different location.

View Lock Clear
   Returns the view to how it was before using *View Lock to Active*.


## Camera View

.. _3dview-camera-navigate:

***********
Camera View
***********

.. figure:: /images/editors_3dview_navigate_camera-view_example.png

   Demonstration of camera view.

The Camera view shows the current scene from the active camera's viewpoint.

The Camera view can be used to virtually compose shots and preview how the scene will look when rendered.
The rendered image will contain everything within the dashed frame.

.. seealso::

   :doc:`Camera Settings </render/cameras>` for details on how camera settings are used for display and rendering.

.. hint::

   While in camera view, you can select the camera by clicking the dashed frame
   (assuming the camera object isn't hidden).


.. _bpy.ops.view3d.view_camera:

Viewing the Active Camera
=========================

.. reference::

   :Mode:      All Modes
   :Menu:      :menuselection:`View --> Cameras --> Active Camera`, :menuselection:`View --> Viewpoint --> Camera`
   :Shortcut:  :kbd:`Numpad0`

This switches the view to the active camera.


.. _bpy.ops.view3d.object_as_camera:

Setting the Active Camera
=========================

.. reference::

   :Mode:      Object Mode
   :Menu:      :menuselection:`View --> Cameras --> Set Active Object as Camera`
   :Shortcut:  :kbd:`Ctrl-Numpad0`

.. figure:: /images/editors_3dview_navigate_camera-view_cameras.png

   Active camera (left) displayed with a solid triangle above it.

This sets the current active object as the active camera and switches to the camera view.

The active camera is the one that will be used for rendering,
and which you'll look through when choosing camera view.

Another way of setting the active camera is through the *Scene* tab of the
:doc:`Properties </editors/properties_editor>`.

.. note::

   The active camera is normally defined on the scene level, so that it's the same
   across all 3D Viewports. However, it's also possible to make a camera
   the active one within one Viewport only.
   See :ref:`Local Camera <bpy.types.SpaceView3D.use_local_camera>`.


Animated Camera Switching
-------------------------

While a scene contains only one camera by default, it's possible to have multiple.
You can then bind the cameras to specific time points in your animation
to create jump cuts showing different viewpoints.
See :ref:`Animating Cameras <bpy.ops.marker.camera_bind>`.


.. _bpy.ops.view3d.view_center_camera:

Frame Camera Bounds
===================

.. reference::

   :Mode:      All Modes
   :Menu:      :menuselection:`View --> Cameras --> Frame Camera Bounds`
   :Shortcut:  :kbd:`Home`

Centers the camera view inside the 3D Viewport's screen area
and resizes the view to fit within the area's bounds.


.. _bpy.ops.view3d.zoom_camera_1_to_1:

Zoom Camera 1:1
===============

.. reference::

   :Mode:      All Modes
   :Menu:      :menuselection:`View --> Navigation --> Zoom Camera 1:1`

Zooms the view so that the camera frame has the exact same size
as the output resolution. This allows you to preview exactly how large
objects will be in the rendered image/animation.


Camera Positioning
==================

There are several different ways to position the camera in your scene.
Some of them are explained below.

.. hint::

   The active "camera" might be any kind of object,
   meaning these actions can also be used to position and aim a light for example.


.. _bpy.ops.view3d.camera_to_view:

Align Active Camera to View
---------------------------

.. reference::

   :Mode:      Object Mode
   :Menu:      :menuselection:`View --> Align View --> Align Active Camera to View`
   :Shortcut:  :kbd:`Ctrl-Alt-Numpad0`

Moves and rotates the camera so it perfectly matches your current viewport view.


Camera Navigation
-----------------

By enabling :ref:`Lock Camera to View <bpy.types.SpaceView3D.lock_camera>` in
:menuselection:`Sidebar --> View` and switching to camera view or toggle the lock navigation gizmo button
when in camera view, the camera will become "glued" to the view and follow it around as you navigate.

.. seealso::

   :ref:`Fly/Walk Navigation <3dview-fly-walk>` for first person navigation that moves the active camera too.


Roll, Pan, Dolly, and Track
---------------------------

To perform these camera moves, the camera must first be selected so transform operations apply to it.
The following actions also assume that you are in camera view.
Having done so, you can now manipulate the camera using the same tools that are used to transform any object:

Roll
   Press :kbd:`R` to enter object rotation mode. The default will be to rotate the camera along its local Z axis
   (the axis orthogonal to the camera view), which is the definition of a camera "roll".
Vertical Pan or Pitch
   This is just a rotation along the local X axis. Press :kbd:`R` to enter object rotation mode,
   then :kbd:`X` twice. (The first press selects the *global* axis, the second the *local* axis.
   This works with any axis; see :doc:`Axis Locking </scene_layout/object/editing/transform/control/axis_locking>`).
Horizontal Pan or Yaw
   This corresponds to a rotation around the camera's local Y axis.
   Press :kbd:`R`, then :kbd:`Y` twice.
Dolly
   To dolly the camera, press :kbd:`G` then :kbd:`MMB` (or :kbd:`Z` twice).
Sideways Tracking
   Press :kbd:`G` and move the mouse (you can use :kbd:`X` or :kbd:`Y` twice
   to get purely horizontal or vertical tracking).

## Introduction

************
Introduction
************

To be able to work in the three-dimensional space that Blender uses,
you must be able to change your viewpoint as well as the viewing direction of the scene.
While we will describe the *3D Viewport* editor, most of the other editors have similar functions.
For example, it is possible to pan and zoom in the Image editor.

.. tip::

   Some navigation tools require a middle mouse button or numpad.
   If you don't have one of these, see the :doc:`Keyboard and Mouse </getting_started/configuration/hardware>`
   page of the manual to learn how to work around this.


.. _navigation-gizmo:

Navigation Gizmo
================

The navigation gizmo can be found in the top right of the editor.

.. list-table:: Navigation Gizmo (left) and Navigation Gizmo in camera view (right).

   * - .. figure:: /images/editors_3dview_navigate_introduction_gizmo.png
          :width: 146px

     - .. figure:: /images/editors_3dview_navigate_introduction_gizmo_camera_view.png
          :width: 146px

The Orbit gizmo at the top shows the current orientation of the view.
Dragging it with :kbd:`LMB` will :ref:`orbit <bpy.ops.view3d.view_orbit>` the view.
Clicking any of the axis labels will :doc:`align </editors/3dview/navigate/viewpoint>` the view to that axis.
Clicking the same axis again switches to the opposite side of that same axis.

The four buttons below the orbit gizmo do the following:

- :ref:`Zoom the 3D Viewport <bpy.ops.view3d.zoom>`
- :ref:`Pan the 3D Viewport <bpy.ops.view3d.view_pan>`
- :doc:`Toggle the Camera View </editors/3dview/navigate/camera_view>`
- :doc:`Toggle the Projection </editors/3dview/navigate/projections>` /
  :ref:`Toggle Lock Camera to View <bpy.types.SpaceView3D.lock_camera>` (in camera view)


## Local View

.. _bpy.ops.view3d.localview:
.. _editors-3dview-navigate-views-local:

**********
Local View

Toggle Local View
=================

.. reference::

   :Mode:      All modes
   :Menu:      :menuselection:`View --> Local View --> Toggle Local View`
   :Shortcut:  :kbd:`NumpadSlash`, :kbd:`Slash`

Global view shows all 3D objects in the scene. Local view isolates the selected object(s)
so that they are the only ones visible in the viewport. This is useful for working on
objects that are obscured by others, or to speed up the viewport performance in heavy scenes.
Local view is contextual, meaning that it can be set per 3D Viewport.

You can toggle between *Global* and *Local View* by selecting the option
from the View menu or using the shortcut :kbd:`NumpadSlash`.

.. list-table::

   * - .. figure:: /images/editors_3dview_navigate_local-view_local1.png
          :width: 320px

          Global View.

     - .. figure:: /images/editors_3dview_navigate_local-view_local2.png
          :width: 320px

          Local View.

.. note::

   In local view, the 3D cursor is not locked to the scene.
   Instead, each view has an independent cursor location.

.. tip::

   Accidentally pressing :kbd:`NumpadSlash` can happen rather often if you are new to Blender,
   so if a bunch of the objects in your scene seem to have mysteriously vanished,
   try pressing :kbd:`NumpadSlash` again.


.. _bpy.ops.view3d.localview_remove_from:

Remove from Local View
----------------------

.. reference::

   :Mode:      All modes
   :Menu:      :menuselection:`View --> Local View --> Remove from Local View`
   :Shortcut:  :kbd:`Alt-NumpadSlash`, :kbd:`Alt-Slash`

Objects can be removed from Local View by selecting them and using the *Remove from Local View* operator.
This will move them back to the global view. If the last remaining object is removed,
the local view will be left empty and you will have to exit it to see any objects.

.. hint::

   This is useful when working with objects in dense scenes where painstakingly selecting objects to include in
   the local view isn't practical, especially when they intersect or are obscured by objects you don't want
   to include. In this case it's simpler to select many objects in a region and enter local view, then
   remove the ones you don't need.


## Navigation

.. _bpy.ops.view3d.view_orbit:

Orbit
=====

.. reference::

   :Mode:      All modes
   :Menu:      :menuselection:`View --> Navigation --> Orbit`
   :Shortcut:  :kbd:`MMB`, :kbd:`Numpad2`, :kbd:`Numpad4`, :kbd:`Numpad6`, :kbd:`Numpad8`.

Rotate the view around the point of interest by clicking and dragging
:kbd:`MMB` on the viewport's area.

:kbd:`RMB` cancels the orbit operation.

The :kbd:`Alt` key has several effects on orbiting:

- Clicking a point with :kbd:`Alt-MMB` will make it the point of interest:
  it becomes the central point which the view orbits around.
- Holding :kbd:`Alt` and then dragging with :kbd:`MMB` in a certain direction
  will :doc:`align </editors/3dview/navigate/viewpoint>` the view to an axis
  and make it orthographic.
- Dragging with :kbd:`MMB` and then holding :kbd:`Alt`
  will perform an orbit while also snapping to the world axes,
  as well as the diagonals between them.

To change the viewing angle in discrete steps, use :kbd:`Numpad8` and :kbd:`Numpad2`
to go up and down, or :kbd:`Numpad4` and :kbd:`Numpad6` for left and right.
You can also press :kbd:`Numpad9` to switch to the opposite side of the view
(rotates the camera 180° around the Z axis).

.. seealso::

   - :ref:`Orbit Style Preference <prefs-input-orbit-style>`
   - :ref:`Auto-Perspective Preference <bpy.types.PreferencesInput.use_auto_perspective>`


.. _bpy.ops.view3d.view_roll:

Roll
====

.. reference::

   :Mode:      All modes
   :Menu:      :menuselection:`View --> Navigation --> Roll`
   :Shortcut:  :kbd:`Shift-Numpad4`, :kbd:`Shift-Numpad6`

Rotate the viewport camera around its viewing direction in 15° discrete steps by default.
See the :ref:`rotation angle <bpy.types.PreferencesView.rotation_angle>` preference to configure.

To reset the roll, you can first align the view to the global X axis
using :kbd:`Numpad3`, then orbit to get back to the regular perspective view.

:kbd:`RMB` cancels the roll operation.

.. _bpy.ops.view3d.view_pan:

Pan
===

.. reference::

   :Mode:      All modes
   :Menu:      :menuselection:`View --> Navigation --> Pan`
   :Shortcut:  :kbd:`Shift-MMB`, :kbd:`Ctrl-Numpad2`, :kbd:`Ctrl-Numpad4`,
               :kbd:`Ctrl-Numpad6`, :kbd:`Ctrl-Numpad8`

Moves the view up, down, left and right.
To pan the view, hold down :kbd:`Shift` and drag :kbd:`MMB` in the 3D Viewport.
For discrete steps, use the hotkeys :kbd:`Ctrl-Numpad8`, :kbd:`Ctrl-Numpad2`,
:kbd:`Ctrl-Numpad4` and :kbd:`Ctrl-Numpad6` as with orbiting.

:kbd:`RMB` cancels the orbit operation.

.. _bpy.ops.view3d.zoom:

Zoom In/Out
===========

.. reference::

   :Mode:      All modes
   :Menu:      :menuselection:`View --> Navigation --> Zoom In/Out`
   :Shortcut:  :kbd:`Ctrl-MMB`, :kbd:`Wheel`, :kbd:`NumpadPlus`, :kbd:`NumpadMinus`

Moves the view closer to, or further away from, the point of interest.
You can zoom in and out by rolling the :kbd:`Wheel` or dragging with :kbd:`Ctrl-MMB`.
To zoom with discrete steps, use the hotkeys :kbd:`NumpadPlus` and :kbd:`NumpadMinus`.

.. hint::

   If you get lost in 3D space (which is not uncommon),
   :ref:`bpy.ops.view3d.view_all` and :ref:`bpy.ops.view3d.view_selected`
   can be used to show the contents of your scene.

:kbd:`RMB` cancels the zoom operation.

.. _bpy.ops.view3d.zoom_border:

Zoom Region
===========

.. reference::

   :Mode:      All modes
   :Menu:      :menuselection:`View --> Navigation --> Zoom Region...`
   :Shortcut:  :kbd:`Shift-B`

The *Zoom Region* tool allows you to specify a rectangular region
by dragging with :kbd:`LMB`. The view will then zoom in on this region.

You can also drag with :kbd:`MMB` to zoom out instead.

.. _bpy.ops.view3d.dolly:

Dolly View
==========

.. reference::

   :Mode:      All modes
   :Menu:      :menuselection:`View --> Navigation --> Dolly View...`
   :Shortcut:  :kbd:`Shift-Ctrl-MMB`

In most cases it's sufficient to zoom the view to get a closer look at something.
However, zooming only gets you up to the point of interest and no further.
If you hit this point where zooming no longer works, you can instead Dolly
by holding :kbd:`Shift-Ctrl` and dragging up or down with :kbd:`MMB`.
This will move the point of interest (and the view along with it).

:kbd:`RMB` cancels the dolly operation.

.. hint::

   Dolly changes orthographic views to a perspective projection.

   This is done because dolly doesn't work well with an orthographic projection because *moving* forwards/backwards
   with an orthographic projection doesn't have the effect of zooming.

.. NOTE(@campbellbarton): "Frame All" & "Frame Selected" could be documented elsewhere,
   however there doesn't seem to be an ideal location as only items in the View sub-menus have their own files.
   Loosely speaking these are navigation - so keep here.

.. _bpy.ops.view3d.view_all:

Frame All
=========

.. reference::

   :Mode:      All modes
   :Menu:      :menuselection:`View --> Frame All`
   :Shortcut:  :kbd:`Home`

Changes the view so that you can see all objects.


.. _bpy.ops.view3d.view_selected:

Frame Selected
==============

.. reference::

   :Mode:      All modes

## Projections

Perspective/Orthographic
************************

.. reference::

   :Mode:      All modes
   :Menu:      :menuselection:`View --> Perspective/Orthographic`
   :Shortcut:  :kbd:`Numpad5`

This operator changes the projection of the viewport camera.
Each 3D Viewport supports two different types of projection.
These are demonstrated in the Fig. below.

.. list-table::

   * - .. figure:: /images/editors_3dview_navigate_projections_view-orthographic.png
          :width: 320px

          Orthographic projection.

     - .. figure:: /images/editors_3dview_navigate_projections_view-perspective.png
          :width: 320px

          Perspective projection.

Our eyes are used to perspective viewing where distant objects appear smaller.
Orthographic projection often seems a bit odd at first,
because objects stay the same size regardless of their distance.
It is like viewing the scene from an infinitely distant point.
Nevertheless, orthographic viewing can be very useful,
because it provides a more "technical" insight into the scene,
making it easier to model and judge proportions.


Options
=======

To toggle between the two projections for the 3D Viewport, select
:menuselection:`View --> Perspective/Orthographic` or use the shortcut
:kbd:`Numpad5`. Changing the projection for a 3D Viewport does not affect
the way the scene will be rendered. Rendering is in perspective by default.
If you need to create an orthographic rendering, select the camera, go to
the Camera tab in the :doc:`Properties editor </editors/properties_editor>`,
and set the Type in the Lens panel to *Orthographic*.

.. seealso::

## Regions

View Regions

.. _bpy.ops.view3d.clip_border:

Clipping Region
===============

.. reference::

   :Mode:      All modes
   :Menu:      :menuselection:`View --> View Regions --> Clipping Region...`
   :Shortcut:  :kbd:`Alt-B`

Allows you to define a clipping region to limit the 3D Viewport display to a portion of 3D space.
It can assist in the process of working with complex models and scenes.

Once activated, you have to draw a rectangle with the mouse.
It becomes a clipping volume of four planes:

- A right-angled `parallelepiped <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallelepiped>`__
  (of infinite length) if your view is orthographic.
- A rectangular-based pyramid (of infinite height) if your view is in perspective.

Once clipping is used, you will only see what's inside the volume you defined.
Tools such as paint, sculpt, selection, transform snapping, etc.
will also ignore geometry outside the clipping bounds.

To delete this clipping, press :kbd:`Alt-B` again.


Example
-------

.. list-table:: Region/Volume clipping.

   * - .. figure:: /images/editors_3dview_navigate_regions_border1.png
          :width: 320px

          Selecting a region.

     - .. figure:: /images/editors_3dview_navigate_regions_border2.png
          :width: 320px

          Region selected.

     - .. figure:: /images/editors_3dview_navigate_regions_border3.png
          :width: 320px

          View rotated.

The *Region/Volume clipping* image shows an example of using the clipping tool with a cube.
Start by activating the tool with :kbd:`Alt-B`.
This will generate a dashed cross-hair cursor.
Click with the :kbd:`LMB` and drag out a rectangular region.
Now clipping is applied against that region in 3D space.
Use the :kbd:`MMB` to rotate
the view and you will see that only what is inside the clipping volume is visible.
All the editing tools still function as normal, but only within the clipping volume.

The dark gray area is the clipping volume itself.
Once clipping is deactivated with another :kbd:`Alt-B`,
all of 3D space will become visible again.

Render Region
=============

.. reference::

   :Mode:      All modes
   :Menu:      :menuselection:`View --> View Regions --> Render Region...`
               :menuselection:`View --> View Regions --> Clear Render Region`
   :Shortcut:  Mark: :kbd:`Ctrl-B`
               Clear: :kbd:`Ctrl-Alt-B`

Allows you to limit rendering to a 2D rectangular area. If you're busy tweaking
just a small part of the scene, it can be quite wasteful to have the whole viewport in
:ref:`Rendered shading mode <view3d-viewport-shading>` or make full-frame renders,
so this feature lets you save time.

You can define Render Regions in two different contexts:

- If you define one while in :doc:`Camera View </editors/3dview/navigate/camera_view>`,
  it will apply not just to the viewport, but also to the final render.
  If you want to temporarily disable this region rather than clearing it entirely,
  you can do so in the Output tab of the :ref:`Properties <bpy.types.RenderSettings.use_border>` editor.
- If you define one while not in Camera View, it will only apply to the viewport.
  If you want to temporarily disable this region rather than clearing it entirely,
  you can do so in the :ref:`Sidebar <bpy.types.SpaceView3D.use_render_border>`.

Both Render Regions can exist at the same time.

.. list-table:: Render region and associated render.
   :widths: 65 35

   * - .. figure:: /images/editors_3dview_navigate_regions_render-border-1.png

     - .. figure:: /images/editors_3dview_navigate_regions_render-border-2.png

.. note::

   Render regions only apply to the viewport when using Cycles, not when using EEVEE.
   However, they always affect the final render.

.. seealso::

   :ref:`bpy.ops.view3d.zoom_border`.


## Viewpoint

.. _bpy.ops.view3d.view_axis:

*********
Viewpoint
*********

The menu :menuselection:`View --> Viewpoint` lets you align the viewing direction to
a specific axis. This can also be done using the :ref:`Navigation Gizmo <navigation-gizmo>`
or the following hotkeys:

:Top: :kbd:`Numpad7`
:Front: :kbd:`Numpad1`
:Right: :kbd:`Numpad3`

:Bottom: :kbd:`Ctrl-Numpad7`
:Back: :kbd:`Ctrl-Numpad1`
:Left: :kbd:`Ctrl-Numpad3`

The above hotkeys align the view to a global (world) axis. You can also align to a local axis
of the selected item by additionally holding :kbd:`Shift`. This way, you can for example
view any mesh face head-on, no matter how it's oriented.
(To get out of this local viewpoint, simply align to a global axis again.)

The view can also be aligned by holding :kbd:`Alt-MMB` and dragging the mouse in a certain direction.


## Views


****************
Contextual Views
****************

By default, the 3D Viewport only shows the scene from one viewpoint.
By using Quad Views, you can see it from multiple viewpoints at the same time,
which gives more context about the changes you're making.


.. _bpy.ops.screen.region_quadview:

Quad View
=========

.. reference::

   :Mode:      All modes
   :Menu:      :menuselection:`View --> Area --> Toggle Quad View`
   :Shortcut:  :kbd:`Ctrl-Alt-Q`

Toggling Quad View will split the 3D Viewport into four views:
three orthographic side views and one user perspective view.

.. note::

   Quad View is different from :doc:`splitting the area </interface/window_system/areas>`
   and aligning the views manually. In Quad View, the four views are still part of a single 3D Viewport,
   so that they share the same display options.

.. _bpy.types.RegionView3D.lock_rotation:

Lock Rotation
   When disabled, makes it possible to orbit in the orthographic views as well
   (turning them into perspective views instead).

.. _bpy.types.RegionView3D.show_sync_view:

Sync Zoom/Pan
   Syncs the view position between side views. (Requires *Lock Rotation* to be enabled.)

   Clip objects based on what is visible in the other side views.


## Walk Fly

.. _3dview-fly-walk:

*******************
Fly/Walk Navigation
*******************

The standard navigation controls are sometimes limiting,
especially for large environments such as architectural models.
In these cases, it may be preferable to use first person controls instead,
where you can look around while "standing" in one place
rather than orbiting around a central viewpoint.

Blender offers two such alternative navigation methods: Flying and Walking.
You can initiate either method from the :menuselection:`View --> Navigation`
menu. You can also initiate your preferred one (configured
in the :doc:`Preferences </editors/preferences/navigation>`)
by pressing :kbd:`Shift-AccentGrave`.

.. figure:: /images/editors_3dview_navigate_walk-fly_view-navigation-panel.png

   View Navigation.

Common use cases for Fly/Walk include:

Navigating
   This can be a quick way to navigate a large scene.
Positioning a camera
   When activated from a camera view :kbd:`Numpad0`,
   the camera will move along with you.
Recording camera movement
   You can record the path you take by entering a camera view, enabling
   Auto Keying in the :doc:`Timeline </editors/timeline>`,
   starting animation playback, and finally activating Fly/Walk navigation.
   The path will be recorded as camera keyframes which can then be
   used for rendering.

   Animation playback can't be controlled while Fly/Walk navigation is active,
   so when you're done recording, you first need to exit the navigation
   with :kbd:`LMB` before you can stop playback.


.. _bpy.ops.view3d.walk:

Walk Navigation
===============

.. reference::

   :Mode:      All modes
   :Menu:      :menuselection:`View --> Navigation --> Walk Navigation`

This navigation method behaves like a typical first person game.
It works with a combination of keyboard keys and mouse movement.

On activation, the cursor is centered inside a rectangle that defines a safe zone.
When the cursor is outside this zone, the view will rotate/pan.


Usage
-----

Move the mouse outside the safe zone in the direction you want to look.

Click :kbd:`LMB` or press :kbd:`Spacebar` to keep the current view and exit Fly navigation.
In case you want to go back to where you started, press :kbd:`Esc` or :kbd:`RMB`.

   * - :kbd:`A`/:kbd:`Left`
     - Accelerate left.
   * - :kbd:`D`/:kbd:`Right`
     - Accelerate right.
   * - :kbd:`E`
     - Accelerate upward.
   * - :kbd:`Q`
     - Accelerate downward.
   * - :kbd:`MMB`
     - Drag to pan the view. Flying will pause while you're doing this.
   * - :kbd:`WheelUp`/:kbd:`NumpadPlus`
     - Increase the acceleration in the direction of motion.
       If there is no motion, start accelerating forward.
   * - :kbd:`WheelDown`/:kbd:`NumpadMinus`
     - Decrease the acceleration in the direction of motion.
       If there is no motion, start accelerating backward.
   * - :kbd:`Alt`
     - Slow down as long as the key is held, until the view eventually comes to a standstill.
   * - :kbd:`Ctrl`
     - Disable rotation -- while held, the view rotation doesn't influence the flight direction.
       This allows you to fly past an object, keeping it centered in the view
       even as you fly away from it.
   * - :kbd:`X`
     - Toggle X axis correction. If enabled, the view will smoothly pitch to look at the
       horizon when the cursor is in the safe zone.
   * - :kbd:`Z`
     - Toggle Z axis correction. If enabled, the view will smoothly roll to an upright
       orientation.

Tool Settings
=============

Depth
   The initial depth (from the screen into the scene) used when placing the object.

   :Surface:
      Start placing on the surface under the mouse cursor.
      If there is no surface, this does the same as *Cursor Plane*.
   :Cursor Plane:
      Start placing on a plane that goes through the :doc:`3D Cursor </editors/3dview/3d_cursor>`
      and is aligned according to the *Orientation* and *Plane Axis*.
   :Cursor View: Start placing on a plane that goes through the 3D Cursor and is aligned to the view.

Orientation
   The new object's orientation -- a set of three axes, out of which *Plane Axis* chooses one.

   :Surface: The object uses the normal orientation of the surface under the mouse cursor.
             If there is no surface, this does the same as *Default*.
   :Default: The object uses the default :doc:`/editors/3dview/controls/orientation`.

Snap To
   The target to use while :doc:`/editors/3dview/controls/snapping`.

   :Geometry: Snap to all types of geometry (vertices, edges, and faces).
   :Default: Snap to the target defined in the global snapping options.

Plane Axis
   Which of the three *Orientation* axes (X, Y or Z) is "up" for the object.
   The object's base will be perpendicular to this axis.

Auto Axis
   Rather than using the *Orientation* axis indicated by *Plane Axis*,
   use the one that's closest to the viewport's viewing direction
   (when not hovering over a surface).


.. rubric:: Base

Origin
   How the base is defined.

   :Edge: The base is defined from one corner to the opposing corner.
   :Center: The base is defined from the centerpoint to a corner.

Aspect
   Whether the base has a free or fixed aspect ratio.

   :Free: The width and depth of the base can be chosen independently.
   :Fixed: The width and depth of the base are forced to be equal.


.. rubric:: Height

Origin
   How the height is defined.

   :Edge: The base becomes the bottom, after which you define the top.
   :Center: The base becomes the center, after which you define the top.

Aspect
   Whether the side of the bounding box has a free or fixed aspect ratio.

   :Free: The height can be chosen independently of the base.
   :Fixed: The height is forced to be equal to the largest side of the base.

Subdivisions
   Influences how many vertices are used to define the sphere.
   At level 1 the icosphere is an icosahedron, a solid with 20 equilateral triangular faces.
   Each increase in the number of subdivisions splits each triangular face into four.

   .. note::

      Subdividing an icosphere raises the vertex count very quickly even with few iterations
      (10 times creates 5,242,880 triangles).
      Adding such a dense mesh is a sure way to cause the program to crash.


## Add Uvsphere

Measure
*******

.. reference::

   :Mode:      All Modes
   :Tool:      :menuselection:`Toolbar --> Measure`

The *Measure* tool is an interactive tool where you can drag lines in the scene to measure distances or angles.
Snapping to geometry could be activated for better accuracy or to measure wall thickness.
The *Measure* tool can be accessed from the Toolbar.

.. figure:: /images/editors_3dview_toolbar_measure_ruler-example.png

   Examples of the Measure tool.


Usage
=====

Here are some common steps for using the *Measure* tool:

#. Activate the *Measure* tool from the Toolbar.
#. Click and drag in the viewport to define the initial start and end point for the ruler.
   You can add multiple rulers in the viewport.
#. Drag either end of the ruler to move it.

   - Holding :kbd:`Ctrl` while moving enables snapping to edges and vertices.
   - Holding :kbd:`Shift` while moving lets you measure the distance between faces.
     This only works well with parallel faces, e.g. walls.

   You can always navigate (pan, zoom, ...)
   or change the view (orthogonal, perspective) in the viewport to have better access to the ruler.

#. Click on the midpoint of a created ruler to convert it to a protractor.
   The midpoint can then be dragged just like the endpoints.
#. A selected ruler can be deleted with :kbd:`Delete` or :kbd:`X`.
   To delete all measurements, delete the "RulerData3D" layer in
   the :menuselection:`Sidebar --> View --> Annotations` panel (see image above).

All measurements are hidden when another tool is selected.
They are shown when the *Measure* tool is selected again.
However, you can do editing operations while the ruler is active.
For example, you can edit the rotation or scale of the selected object in the Sidebar.

Measurements do not appear in the Render output.

Unit settings and scale from the scene are used for displaying dimensions.
Changing the unit system (metric, imperial), or the units of length (cm, m, ...)
or angle (degrees, radians) will update the measurements.

.. tip::

   In Edit Mode only, there is also a *Measurement* group in the
   :doc:`Viewport Overlays </editors/3dview/display/overlays>` popover.
   Using the settings in this group, you can have the viewport automatically
   display measurements for selected edges and faces, without the need to
   manually create a ruler.

Footage
=======

.. _bpy.types.MovieClipProxy:

Proxy/Timecode
--------------

.. figure:: /images/editors_clip_sidebar_proxy-panel.png
   :align: right

High-resolution video files can impact Blender's performance, slowing down scrubbing and other operations.
To counter this, you can generate one or more proxies, which are copies of the original footage
stored at a lower resolution and/or quality. These proxies can then be used as a less resource-heavy
standin while working on the scene.

Build Original
   The proxy resolution(s) to generate based on the original, distorted footage.
Build Undistorted
   The proxy resolution(s) to generate based on the undistorted footage
   (that is, with the :ref:`Lens settings <bpy.types.MovieTrackingCamera.lens>` applied
   to undo the distortion in the recording).
Quality
   The image quality for the proxies.
Proxy Custom Directory
   By default, proxies are stored to a ``BL_proxy`` subfolder next to the original file.
   Use this option to specify a different location.
Build Proxy/Timecode
   Generates proxies based on the settings above, as well as timecode files.
   Instead of using this button, you can also click
   :menuselection:`Clip --> Proxy --> Rebuild Proxy and Timecode Indices`.

.. _bpy.types.MovieClipProxy.timecode:

:term:`Timecode` Index
   When you are working with footage directly copied from a camera without preprocessing it,
   there might be numerous artifacts, mostly due to seeking to a given frame in the sequence.
   This happens because such footage usually does not have correct frame rate values in the file header.
   This issue can still arise when the source clip has the same frame rate as the scene settings.
   In order for Blender to correctly calculate the frames and frame rate there are two possible solutions:

   #. Preprocess your video with e.g. MEncoder to repair the file header and insert the correct keyframes.
   #. Use the Timecode Index option in Blender.

   :None:
      Ignore generated timecodes, seek in movie stream based on calculated timestamp.
   :Record Run:
      Seek based on timestamps read from movie stream, giving the best match between scene and movie times.
   :Record Run No Gaps:
      Effectively convert movie to an image sequence,
      ignoring incomplete or dropped frames, and changes in frame rate.

   .. note::

      *Record Run* is the Timecode Index which usually is best to use, but if the source file is totally damaged,
      *Record Run No Gaps* will be the only chance of getting an acceptable result.

Proxy Render Size
   Which proxy size to use for display. Depending on the
   :ref:`Render Undistorted <bpy.types.MovieClipUser.use_render_undistorted>` setting,
   Blender will use either the Original proxy or the Undistorted proxy.


Footage Settings
----------------

See :doc:`/editors/image/image_settings`.


Track
=====

See :doc:`/movie_clip/tracking/clip/sidebar/track/index`.


Stabilization
=============

See :doc:`/movie_clip/tracking/clip/sidebar/stabilization/index`.


View
====

.. _bpy.types.SpaceClipEditor.cursor:

2D Cursor
---------

The 2D Cursor is the dashed crosshair in the main region. It can be used as a
transformation :doc:`pivot point </editors/3dview/controls/pivot_point/index>`
by selecting the corresponding option in the editor's header.

Note that the 2D Cursor is only available in Mask mode, not in Tracking mode.

.. _bpy.types.SpaceClipEditor.cursor_location:

Location X, Y
   The relative location of the 2D Cursor, going from (0, 0) for the bottom left
   corner to (1, 1) for the top right corner.

   You can also position the 2D Cursor by clicking :kbd:`Shift-RMB`
   in (or around) the video.

Annotations
-----------

See :doc:`/interface/annotate_tool`.


## Clip Display

.. _clip-editor-clip-display-label:

************
Clip Display
************

This pop-over contains various display settings for both Tracking mode and Mask mode.

.. _bpy.types.SpaceClipEditor.show_red_channel:
.. _bpy.types.SpaceClipEditor.show_green_channel:
.. _bpy.types.SpaceClipEditor.show_blue_channel:

R, G, B
   Controls the color channels used for the frame preview. The tracking algorithm works with grayscale images,
   and with these options, you can check which combination of enabled and disabled channels will yield
   the best contrast and the least noise.

   Note that this only affects the preview. To select which channels to use for the actual tracking,
   use the :doc:`Track tab in the Toolbar </movie_clip/tracking/clip/toolbar/track>` to set a default
   for newly created markers, or the :doc:`Track tab in the Sidebar </movie_clip/tracking/clip/sidebar/track/track>`
   to configure existing markers.

.. _bpy.types.SpaceClipEditor.use_grayscale_preview:

Grayscale Preview (B/W)
   Shows the whole frame as a grayscale image.

.. _bpy.types.SpaceClipEditor.use_mute_footage:

Mute (eye icon) :kbd:`M`
   Hides the movie clip and displays a black image instead.
   This helps to find markers that are tracked inaccurately or not at all.

.. _bpy.types.MovieClipUser.use_render_undistorted:

Render Undistorted
   Applies the :ref:`Lens settings <bpy.types.MovieTrackingCamera.lens>` to the
   video preview to undo lens distortion. Does not change the footage itself.

.. _bpy.types.SpaceClipEditor.show_stable:

Show Stable
   Applies the :doc:`2D stabilization </movie_clip/tracking/clip/sidebar/stabilization/introduction>`
   settings to the video preview. Does not change the footage itself.

.. _bpy.types.SpaceClipEditor.show_grid:

Grid
   Displays a grid which is originally orthographic, but is distorted by the Lens settings.
   This can be used for manual calibration: the distorted grid lines should match lines
   in the footage that are meant to be straight.

.. _bpy.types.SpaceClipEditor.use_manual_calibration:

Calibration
   Applies the Lens settings to annotation strokes.
   Like the Grid, this option also helps to perform manual calibration.

.. _bpy.types.MovieClip.display_aspect:

Display Aspect Ratio
   Changes the aspect ratio for displaying only. It does not affect the tracking or solving process.


Marker Display
==============

Determines how markers are displayed in the editor.

Pattern
   Whether to show the pattern areas of tracks. Can be used to reduce clutter and
   check how good tracking is.

Search :kbd:`Alt-S`
   Whether to show the search areas of *selected* tracks. Can be used to reduce clutter and
   check how good tracking is.

Path
   Shows past (red) and future (blue) positions of tracks relative to the current frame,
   visualizing how they move. This makes it easier to spot irregularities.

Length
   Length (in frames) of the *Path*.

Show Disabled :kbd:`Alt-D`
   When unchecked, hides the tracks that are disabled on the current frame
   (except for the active track, i.e. the one that was selected last).
   This helps to make the view more clear and see if the tracking is accurate enough.

Info
   Displays the name and status of each selected track.
   The status can be "keyframed," "tracked," "disabled" and so on.

3D Markers
   Shows the result of :doc:`solving </movie_clip/tracking/clip/toolbar/solve>` the
   markers' 3D locations based on their 2D movement. Each 3D location is projected
   back to the movie clip and displayed as a small point, which is colored green if
   it's close to the original 2D marker (meaning a good solve) or red if it's far away
   (meaning it needs to be tweaked).

Display Thin
   By default, marker areas are displayed as bright boxes with a black outline.
   This option displays them using thin dashed lines instead.

   Markers in animation editor.

There are some options that are exclusive to the Dope Sheet editor:

Sync Markers
   Whether to also move the selected markers when moving the selected keyframes.
Show Pose Markers :guilabel:`Action Editor`
   Instead of showing the global scene markers, show the local pose markers (which only exist inside the action).
   While this option is active, the *Add Marker* menu item will also create pose markers instead of scene markers.
Make Markers Local :guilabel:`Action Editor`
   Converts the selected scene markers into pose markers,
   making them only visible inside the currently selected action.

For information about the other marker tools, see :ref:`Editing Markers <animation-markers-editing>`.


Channel Menu
^^^^^^^^^^^^

See :doc:`Graph Editor Channels </editors/graph_editor/channels/editing>`.

.. _dopesheet-key-menu:

Key Menu
^^^^^^^^

Most items in this menu are documented on the Graph Editor's :doc:`/editors/graph_editor/fcurves/editing` page.
One important difference is that scaling keyframes in the Dope Sheet Editor only moves them along the time axis
(with the Playhead serving as the pivot point); it doesn't change their values.

The Dope Sheet editor has the following additional menu items:

Slide :kbd:`Shift-T`
   Lets you stretch one set of keyframes across time while compressing an adjacent set to compensate,
   leaving the combined duration the same.

   To use this operator, first select a range of three or more keyframes, then place the mouse cursor
   somewhere in the middle and press :kbd:`Shift-T`. The range will be temporarily split in two
   at the location of the cursor, indicated by a dashed vertical line.
   If you now move the mouse, the two halves of the range will change in length,
   and the keyframes within them will move accordingly. Click :kbd:`LMB` to confirm or :kbd:`RMB` to cancel.

Keyframe Type :kbd:`R`
   Sets the :ref:`type <keyframe-type>` of the selected keyframes.

Snap
^^^^

The toggle button enables/disables automatic keyframe snapping.
The dropdown button shows a popover with the following options:

Snap To
   Type of element to snap to.

   :Frame: Snap to full frames.
   :Second: Snap to seconds.
   :Nearest Marker: Snap to the nearest :doc:`Marker </animation/markers>`.

Absolute Time Snap
   When disabled, keyframes will move in increments of *Snap To*.
   For example, if you selected *Second* and have a keyframe that's currently on
   0:06+5, dragging it to the right will snap it to 0:07+5. Its time
   increases by a second, and its subsecond offset of 5 frames remains the same.

   When enabled, keyframes will snap to multiples of *Snap To*.
   Taking the above example, the keyframe would snap to 0:07+0,
   removing the subsecond offset.

## Introduction

.. index:: Editors; Dope Sheet

************
Introduction
************

The Dope Sheet offers a bird's-eye view of the keyframes inside the scene.
It's inspired by classical hand-drawn animation, where animators make use of a chart
showing exactly when each drawing, sound, and camera move will occur, and for how long.

.. figure:: /images/editors_dope-sheet_introduction_overview.png
   :width: 620px

   The Dope Sheet.


Dope Sheet Modes
================

The editor has several different modes that can be selected from a dropdown in the header.
The default *Dope Sheet* mode gives an overview of most types of animatable data.
For others, such as masks, you need to switch to a more specific mode.

.. figure:: /images/editors_dope-sheet_introduction_modes.png

   Dope Sheet modes.

The modes are as follows:

- Dope Sheet
- :doc:`Action Editor </editors/dope_sheet/modes/action>`
- :doc:`Shape Key Editor </editors/dope_sheet/modes/shape_key>`
- :doc:`Grease Pencil </editors/dope_sheet/modes/grease_pencil>`
- :doc:`Mask </editors/dope_sheet/modes/mask>`
- Cache File: originally meant to show the baked animation data in :doc:`/files/import_export/alembic`
  files, but never implemented.


Main Region
===========

The Dope Sheet Editor shows a stack of :doc:`channels </editors/graph_editor/channels/index>`
(animatable properties), and for each channel, a series of keyframes laid out along the time axis.

.. figure:: /images/editors_dope-sheet_introduction_types.png

   The Dope Sheet Editor with object channels.

Keyframes can take on various colors and shapes:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 20 80

   * - Gray
     - Unselected
   * - Yellow
     - Selected
   * - Other colors
     - Custom keyframe tag set by the user (:menuselection:`Key --> Keyframe Type`)
   * - Diamond
     - Free Keyframe Handle (:menuselection:`Key --> Handle Type`)
   * - Round
     - Auto-Clamped Keyframe Handle
   * - Circle
     - Automatic Keyframe Handle
   * - Square
     - Vector Keyframe Handle
   * - Rhombus
     - Aligned Keyframe Handle
   * - Gray bar between keys
     - Held key (the two keyframes are identical)
   * - Green line between keys
     - The curve segment uses custom interpolation (:menuselection:`Key --> Interpolation Mode`)
   * - Upwards arrow
     - Local maximum in curve (visible if :menuselection:`View --> Show Curve Extremes` is enabled)
   * - Downwards arrow
     - Local minimum in curve

Keyframes can be selected by clicking and moved by dragging. See the :ref:`Select <dopesheet-select-menu>`
and :ref:`Key <dopesheet-key-menu>` menus for more options.


## Navigating


**********
Navigating
**********

As with most editors, you can:

- Pan the view vertically (channels) and horizontally (time) by dragging :kbd:`MMB`.
- Zoom in and out by rolling :kbd:`Wheel` or dragging :kbd:`Ctrl-MMB`.

You can also use the scrollbars for this.

.. _dope-sheet-view-menu:

View Menu
=========

Sidebar :kbd:`N`
   Shows or hides the :ref:`Sidebar Region <ui-region-sidebar>`.
Adjust Last Operation
   Displays a pop-up panel to alter the properties of the last
   completed operation. See :ref:`bpy.ops.screen.redo_last`.
Channels
   Shows or hides the Channels region (the list of animated property names on the left).

----------

Frame Selected :kbd:`NumpadPeriod`
   Pans and zooms the view to focus on the selected keyframes.
Frame All :kbd:`Home`
   Pans and zooms the view to show all keyframes.
Go to Current Frame :kbd:`Numpad0`
   Pans the view so the Playhead is in the center.

----------

Multi-Word Match Search
   Lets you filter by multiple search terms instead of just one (in the search textbox above the
   channel list and in the :ref:`Filters popover <bpy.types.DopeSheet.filter_fcurve_name>`).
   The terms are space-separated, so you can for example type "loc rot" to find all channels that
   have "loc" or "rot" in their name. If this option were disabled, the list would only show
   channels containing the text "loc rot", of which there are likely none.

----------

Realtime Updates
   Whether to update other views (such as the 3D Viewport) while you're moving keyframes around.
   If disabled, the other views only get updated once you finish the move.

.. figure:: /images/animation_keyframes_introduction_sliders.png
   :align: right

   Sliders.

Show Sliders
   Shows a value slider next to each channel. Adjusting such a slider automatically creates a keyframe.

.. figure:: /images/animation_keyframes_introduction_interpolation.png
   :align: right

   Handle types.

Show Handles and Interpolation
   Displays keyframes using shapes that represent their Bézier handle type.
   In addition, if a keyframe uses a non-default interpolation type for the curve segment
   that comes after it, this is indicated by a green line.

   See :ref:`Handles & Interpolation Display <keyframe-handle-display>`.

.. figure:: /images/editors_dope-sheet_introduction_extremes.png
   :align: right

   Extreme markers.

Show Curve Extremes
   Detects keys where the curve changes direction, and marks them by displaying an arrow inside their shape.
   Local maxima (hills) are shown as up arrows, while local minima (valleys) are shown as down arrows.

   A keyframe may show both arrows, namely when it's part of a summary row containing a channel with a
   maximum and one with a minimum.

Auto-Merge Keyframes
   Automatically merge keyframes that end up on the same frame after transformation.

----------

Show Markers
   Shows the marker region (provided any markers have been defined).
   When disabled, the :ref:`Marker menu <dopesheet-marker-menu>` is also hidden and marker operators are
   not available in this editor.
Show Seconds :kbd:`Ctrl-T`
   Shows timing in seconds instead of frames.
Sync Visible Range
   Synchronizes the horizontal panning and scale of the editor
   with other time-based editors that also have this option enabled.
   That way, they always show the same section of time.

----------

Set Preview Range :kbd:`P`
   Lets you drag a box to define a time range for previewing. As long as this range is active,
   playback will be limited to it, letting you repeatedly view a segment of the animation without
   having to manually rewind each time.

   You can change the start or end frame using the corresponding button in the
   Timeline editor's :ref:`Playback <timeline-playback>` popover.
   Alternatively, you can simply run *Set Preview Range* again.
Clear Preview Range :kbd:`Alt-P`
   Clears the preview range.
Set Preview Range to Selected :kbd:`Ctrl-Alt-P`
   Applies a preview range that encompasses the selected keyframes.

----------

Toggle Graph Editor :kbd:`Ctrl-Tab`
   Changes the area's editor to the :doc:`/editors/graph_editor/index`.

----------

Area
   Area controls. See the :doc:`user interface </interface/window_system/areas>`
   documentation for more information.


Filters
=======

These filters are available in the funnel dropdown button in the header.

.. _bpy.types.DopeSheet.show_summary:

Summary
   Toggles the "Summary" row at the top of the Channels region.
   This row shows the union of all keyframes across all channels.

.. _bpy.types.DopeSheet.show_only_selected:

Only Show Selected
   Only show keyframes belonging to objects/bones/... that are selected.
Show Hidden
   Show keyframes from objects/bones/... that are hidden.
Only Show Errors
   Only show channels that have errors (for example, because they try to animate a property that doesn't
   exist on the object).

.. _bpy.types.DopeSheet.filter_fcurve_name:

Search
   Filters the channel list by a search term (or multiple search terms if *Multi-Word Match Search*
   is enabled).

Filtering Collection
   Select a collection to only show keyframes from objects in that collection.

Filter by Type
   Filter curves by property type.

Sort Data-Blocks
   Sorts data-blocks alphabetically to make them easier to find.

   If your playback speed suffers because of this
   (should only really be an issue when working with lots of objects),
   you can turn it off.

Action Panel
============

.. figure:: /images/animation_actions_range.png
   :align: center

   Actions with and without a Manual Frame Range in Dope Sheet.

When the editor is in :doc:`Action Editor </editors/dope_sheet/modes/action>` mode,
or in Dope Sheet mode with a channel selected that belongs to an action,
this panel allows changing some settings of that action.
See :ref:`Action Properties <actions-properties>` for details.


Custom Properties
=================

Create and manage your own properties to store data in the action's data block.
See the :ref:`Custom Properties <files-data_blocks-custom-properties>` page for more information.


## Action


*************
Action Editor
*************

While the *Dope Sheet* mode lets you work with keyframes of many objects at the same time,
the *Action Editor* mode focuses on the keyframes inside a single :doc:`action </animation/actions>`.

.. figure:: /images/editors_dope-sheet_action-editor.png

   The Action Editor.

An action is a reusable animation segment -- a collection of
:doc:`F-curves </editors/graph_editor/fcurves/introduction>`, where each curve describes how
a certain property changes over time. Objects can reference one action as their *active action*
and additional ones through :doc:`Nonlinear Animation tracks </editors/nla/tracks>`.


Header
======

Previous/Next Layer (down/up arrows)
   Switches to editing the action in the track below/above the current one,
   automatically entering or leaving Tweak Mode as necessary. Also transfers
   the *Disable NLA stack* setting to the *Solo* setting and vice versa
   (see :doc:`NLA tracks </editors/nla/tracks>`).

.. figure:: /images/editors_dope-sheet_action-editor_layers_1.png

   By default, the Action Editor shows the selected object's active action,
   which is stored in the Action Track at the top.

.. figure:: /images/editors_dope-sheet_action-editor_layers_2.png

   After clicking *Previous Layer*, we enter Tweak Mode for the action in the second track.
   The NLA Editor hilights it in green, and the Action Editor lets us edit its keyframes.

Push Down (strips with down arrow icon)
   Creates a new NLA track below the Action Track and moves the active action into it.
   This is the same as clicking :ref:`Push Down Action <bpy.ops.nla.action_pushdown>`
   in the NLA editor.
Stash (snowflake icon)
   Creates a new *muted* NLA track at the bottom and moves the active action into it.
   In effect, this sets the action aside for later use, disabling it so it no longer
   affects the animation. Later, you can choose to either unmute it again or delete it.

   If you click *New Action* in the data-block menu for an object that already has an
   active action, that previous action will be stashed automatically.

.. note::

   Both *Push Down* and *Stash* leave the object without an active action (meaning the Action Editor
   becomes empty and the action can no longer be edited). If you still want to make changes to the
   action, you can select it in the NLA editor and press :kbd:`Tab` to enter Tweak Mode,
   or use the Previous/Next Layer buttons as described above.


.. _dopesheet-action-action:

Action
   A :ref:`data-block menu <ui-data-block>` that lets you change -- or clear --
   the object's active action.


## Grease Pencil


*************
Grease Pencil
*************

This mode lets you adjust the timing of a :doc:`Grease Pencil object's </grease_pencil/introduction>`
animation frames. It is especially useful for blocking out shots.

.. figure:: /images/editors_dope-sheet_grease-pencil_view.png


Channels Region
===============

The Channels region shows the Grease Pencil object in light blue and its
:doc:`layers </grease_pencil/properties/layers>` in gray.
Layers have the following settings:

Opacity
   The layer's :ref:`opacity <bpy.types.GPencilLayer.opacity>`.
Use Mask
   Toggle the layer's :doc:`masks </grease_pencil/properties/masks>` on or off.
Onion Skinning
   Toggle :doc:`onion skinning </grease_pencil/properties/onion_skinning>`.
Visibility (eye icon)
   Toggle layer visibility in the viewport and in render.
Show all keyframes (checkbox)
   When unchecked, the layer gets frozen in its current state, and moving to
   a different keyframe will no longer change its appearance.
Lock (padlock)
   Locked layers can't be edited.


Header
======

Add New Layer
   Adds a layer.
Remove Layer
   Removes the active layer.
Move Layer
   Moves the active layer down/up.
Isolate Layer (monitor icon)
   Hide all layers except the active one.
Isolate Layer (padlock icon)
   Lock all layers except the active one.

Insert Keyframe
---------------

You can press :kbd:`I` while hovering over the Dope Sheet Editor to insert a keyframe.
It'll create a copy of the active frame if
:ref:`Additive Drawing <bpy.types.ToolSettings.use_gpencil_draw_onback>` is enabled,
and a blank frame otherwise.


Copying Frames
--------------

It is possible to copy frames from one layer to another,
or from object to object, using the *Copy* and *Paste* tools in the *Key* menu.
Note that keyframes will be pasted into selected layers, so make sure you have a destination layer selected.


Main Region
===========

The keyframes can be manipulated like any other data in the *Dope Sheet*.
Interpolated keyframes (alias breakdowns) are visualized as smaller light blue points.


Sidebar
=======

The Sidebar contains a copy of the Grease Pencil :doc:`Layer Properties </grease_pencil/properties/layers>`.

Introduction
************

The Graph Editor lets you edit animation curves, which determine how properties change over time.

.. figure:: /images/editors_graph-editor_introduction_example.png

   The Graph Editor.


Main Region
===========

The curve view allows you to view and edit :doc:`F-Curves </editors/graph_editor/fcurves/introduction>`.
An F-Curve has several key parts:

Curve
   The curve describes how the value of a property (Y axis) evolves over time (X axis).
:doc:`Keyframes </animation/keyframes/index>`
   Keyframes are user-defined values on certain frames and are represented
   by little black discs that become orange when selected.
   The values on the other frames are calculated automatically by interpolating
   between these keyframes.
:ref:`Handles <editors-graph-fcurves-settings-handles>`
   Each keyframe has two handles -- points that can be dragged around to influence
   the shape of the curve around it.

.. figure:: /images/editors_graph-editor_introduction_f-curve-example.png

   A simple curve. The discs are keyframes, and the circles are their handles.

.. seealso::

   See :doc:`F-Curves </editors/graph_editor/fcurves/introduction>` for more info.


Navigation
----------

As with most editors, you can:

Pan
   Pan the view by dragging with :kbd:`MMB`.
Zoom
   Zoom in and out with the mouse :kbd:`Wheel`.
Scale View
   Scale the view horizontally or vertically by dragging with :kbd:`Ctrl-MMB`.

You can also use the scrollbars.

.. tip::

   You can focus the view on the curve of an animated property by right clicking it and choosing
   :menuselection:`View in Graph Editor`. If you want to set up a hotkey for this, you need to open
   the :doc:`/editors/preferences/keymap` preferences, open the *User Interface* category,
   click *Add New*, fill in the operator name ``anim.view_curve_in_graph_editor``, and finally choose
   a shortcut. Normally this can be done more easily by right clicking the context menu item and
   choosing *Assign Shortcut*, but in this case, the shortcut would be added to the wrong category
   and not work.


.. _graph_editor-2d-cursor:

Playhead & 2D Cursor
--------------------

.. figure:: /images/editors_graph-editor_introduction_2dcursor.png
   :align: right

   Graph Editor 2D Cursor.

The current frame is represented by a vertical blue line called the *Playhead*.
As in the :doc:`Timeline </editors/timeline>`,
you can move it by clicking or dragging with :kbd:`LMB` in the scrubbing area at the top.

Combined with the horizontal blue line, the Playhead forms the *2D Cursor*
which can be used as a :doc:`pivot point </editors/3dview/controls/pivot_point/index>`
for rotating and scaling. You can disable the horizontal line using
:menuselection:`View --> Show Cursor` or :menuselection:`Sidebar --> View --> Show Cursor`.

The 2D Cursor can be moved by clicking or dragging with :kbd:`Shift-RMB`
or by adjusting its coordinates in the :ref:`View tab <graph_editor-view-properties>` of the Sidebar.

Normalize
---------

Scales the display of each curve so that they all (appear to) occupy the same value range,
going from -1 to 1. This can make editing easier when you're working with curves whose value
ranges are far apart.

When you enable this option, the view is zoomed accordingly and the area outside the normalized
value range is darkened.

If a preview range is defined, keyframes within the range are normalized,
while the others are scaled proportionally.

Auto Normalization
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Automatically recalculate curve normalization on every curve edit.


View Controls
-------------

.. figure:: /images/editors_graph-editor_introduction_header-view.png

   View controls.

Show Only Selected
   Only show curves belonging to objects/bones/... that are selected.
Show Hidden
   Show keyframes from objects/bones/... that are hidden.
Show Only Errors
   Only show channels that have errors (for example, because they try to animate a property that doesn't
   exist on the object).
Create Ghost Curves (framed F-Curve icon)
   Creates a snapshot of the current curves and shows it in the background
   so that you can use it as a reference. Click the button again to clear the snapshot.
Filter (funnel icon)
   Search
      Filters the channel list by a search term.

   Filtering Collection
      Select a collection to only show keyframes from objects in that collection.

   Filter by Type
      Filter curves by property type.

   Sort Data-Blocks
      Sorts data-blocks alphabetically to make them easier to find.

      If your playback speed suffers because of this
      (should only really be an issue when working with lots of objects),
      you can turn it off.

Transform Controls
------------------

.. figure:: /images/editors_graph-editor_introduction_header-edit.png

   Transform controls.

Pivot Point
   Pivot point for rotating and scaling.

   Bounding Box Center
      Center of the smallest possible box around the selected keyframes.
   2D Cursor
      The intersection between the Playhead and the horizontal Cursor line.
   Individual Centers
      Rotate/scale each handle around its keyframe.

.. _bpy.types.ToolSettings.use_snap_anim:

Snap
   The icon toggles snapping on or off. The dropdown offers the following options:

   .. _bpy.types.ToolSettings.snap_anim_element:

   Snap To
      Type of element to snap to.

      Frame
         Snap to full frames.
      Second
         Snap to seconds.
      Nearest Marker
         Snap to the nearest :doc:`Marker </animation/markers>`.

   .. _bpy.types.ToolSettings.use_snap_time_absolute:

   Absolute Time Snap
      When disabled, keyframes will move in increments of *Snap To*.
      For example, if you selected *Second* and have a keyframe that's currently on
      0:06+5, dragging it to the right will snap it to 0:07+5. Its time
      increases by a second, and its subsecond offset of 5 frames remains the same.

      When enabled, keyframes will snap to multiples of *Snap To*.
      Taking the above example, the keyframe would snap to 0:07+0,
      removing the subsecond offset.

.. _editors-graph_editor-channels_region:

Channels Region
===============

.. figure:: /images/editors_graph-editor_channels_region.png

   The Channels region.

This region is found on the left side of time-based editors like the :doc:`/editors/timeline`,
the :doc:`Dope Sheet Editor </editors/dope_sheet/introduction>`, and the Graph Editor.
It shows a tree of items (objects, bones...) and their animated properties,
with the latter also being called "channels." Each channel has an associated F-curve
describing how its value changes over time.

The rows are color-coded as follows:

- Dark blue: scenes, objects
- Light blue: :doc:`actions </animation/actions>`, :doc:`shape keys </animation/shape_keys/index>` etc.
- Green: channel groups
- Gray: channels

.. _bpy.types.DopeSheet.use_filter_invert:
.. _bpy.types.DopeSheet.filter_text:

Search :kbd:`Ctrl-F`
   Lets you filter the channels by typing a part of their name. Click the Invert button to instead
   show channels that *don't* include the search text.


Controls
--------

The headers contain the following toggle buttons:

Pin (pin icon)
   Keep the row and its children visible even when selecting a different object.
Hide (eye icon)
   Hides the keyframes and curve associated with the channel.
Modifiers (wrench icon)
   Deactivates the modifiers of the curve.
Mute (checkbox)
   Deactivates the curve, making the animation behave as though it doesn't exist.
Lock :kbd:`Tab` (padlock icon)
   Prevent the curve from being edited.

   .. note::

      This also works in the :doc:`Nonlinear Animation Editor </editors/nla/introduction>`,
      but note that it only locks the strips there, not the underlying F-curves.


Selection
---------

- Select single header: click :kbd:`LMB`
- Add/Remove single header to/from selection: click :kbd:`Ctrl-LMB`
- Select range: click :kbd:`Shift-LMB`

Transform
=========

.. reference::

   :Mode:      Edit Mode
   :Menu:      :menuselection:`Key --> Transform`

An F-Curve can be edited by transforming the locations of its keyframes.

Move, Rotate, Scale
   Like other elements in Blender, keyframes can be
   moved, rotated, and scaled as described in
   :doc:`Basic Transformations </scene_layout/object/editing/transform/introduction>`.
Extend :kbd:`E`
   Lets you quickly move the selected keyframes that are on a certain side of the Playhead.
   This is handy if you need to, say, move all the keyframes after a certain time point to
   the right to make space for new ones.

   To use this operator, first select some or all keyframes and place your mouse cursor to
   the left or right of the Playhead. Then, press :kbd:`E`, move the mouse to move (only)
   the keyframes on that side of the Playhead, and press :kbd:`LMB` to confirm
   (or :kbd:`RMB` to cancel).

.. tip::

   You can also change the *Key Frame* and *Value* properties in
   :menuselection:`Sidebar --> F-Curve --> Active Keyframe` if you want to specify exact numbers.

While transforming keyframes, you can hold :kbd:`Shift` to move them more slowly for
better precision, or :kbd:`Ctrl` to move them in coarse increments.

.. _bpy.ops.graph.snap:

Snap
====

.. reference::

:ref:`snapping <bpy.types.ToolSettings.use_snap_anim>` in the header.

Selection to Current Frame
   Set the selected keyframes' time to the current frame.
Selection to Cursor Value
   Set the selected keyframes' value to that of the :ref:`2D Cursor <graph_editor-2d-cursor>`.
Selection to Nearest Frame
   Round the time of each keyframe to the nearest frame.
Selection to Nearest Second
   Round the time of each keyframe to the nearest second. You can use
   :menuselection:`View --> Show Seconds` to show seconds instead of frames
   at the top of the editor.
Selection to Nearest Marker
   Set the time of each keyframe to that of the nearest :doc:`marker </animation/markers>`.
Flatten Handles
   Flatten the *Bézier* handles for the selected keyframes.

Clean Keyframes
---------------

.. reference::

   :Menu:      :menuselection:`Key --> Density --> Clean Keyframes`
   :Shortcut:  :kbd:`X`

Finds redundant keyframes among the selected ones and deletes them. A keyframe is seen as
redundant if it has the same value as its neighbors -- even if the curve segments around it
aren't flat.

.. tip::

   This operator is likely to change the shape of the affected curves, so it's best run after
   e.g. bulk keyframe insertion on all the bones of an armature (which creates useless keyframes
   on bones that haven't moved) and before tweaking the curves by hand.

Threshold
   Value threshold. By increasing this, you can also delete keyframes that *almost* have the
   same value as their neighbors.

Channels
   Cleans all the keyframes (even unselected ones) in the selected F-Curves.
   If a curve is left with only one keyframe, it's deleted entirely.

Adjusts the values of the selected keyframes by a certain percentage. Select a blending operator,
move the mouse left or right to adjust the factor, and click :kbd:`LMB` to confirm
(or :kbd:`RMB` to cancel).

Several blending operators work based on "neighboring keyframes." This means that they divide the
selected keyframes into contiguous groups, then reference the unselected keyframes immediately
before and after each group.

.. _bpy.ops.graph.breakdown:

Breakdown
---------

.. reference::

   :Menu:      :menuselection:`Key --> Blend --> Breakdown`

-----------------

.. reference::

   :Menu:      :menuselection:`Key --> Blend --> Blend to Neighbor`

Moves each selected keyframe towards the value of the left or right neighbor by a certain percentage.

Blend
   When negative, each keyframe moves *Blend* percent to the value of the left neighbor.

   When positive, they move to the right neighbor.

   When zero, they keep their original values.


.. _bpy.ops.graph.blend_to_default:

Blend to Default Value
----------------------

.. reference::

   :Menu:      :menuselection:`Key --> Blend --> Blend to Default Value`

Moves the selected keyframes towards the property's default value by a certain percentage.

Factor
   How much to change the keyframes' values, going from 0 (no change) to 1 (reset to the default value).

.. seealso::

   The :ref:`Reset to Default <bpy.ops.ui.reset_default_button>` operator resets
   any property to its default value without the need of keyframing.


.. _bpy.ops.graph.ease:

Ease
----

.. reference::

   :Menu:      :menuselection:`Key --> Blend --> Ease`

Makes the selected keyframes follow an S-curve. While the slider is visible (so after activating
the operator but before confirming with :kbd:`LMB`), you can press :kbd:`Tab` to toggle which
of the following settings to edit:

Curve Bend
   A negative value gives more weight to the left side, while a positive value gives more weight
   to the right. A value of 0 results in a balanced curve.

Sharpness
   A low value results in an almost straight diagonal line, while a high value results in a steep
   rise/drop in the curve.

.. _bpy.ops.graph.blend_offset:

Blend Offset
------------

.. reference::

   :Menu:      :menuselection:`Key --> Blend --> Blend Offset`

Moves the selected keyframes up or down -- all by the same amount -- until the first/last one matches
the left/right neighbor.

Offset Factor
   At -1, the first selected key gets aligned to its left neighbor.

   At 1, the last selected key gets aligned to its right neighbor.

   At 0, nothing changes.


.. _bpy.ops.graph.blend_to_ease:

Blend to Ease
-------------

.. reference::

   :Menu:      :menuselection:`Key --> Blend --> Blend to Ease`

Blend
   At -1, the keys will follow an "ease in" curve, with small value changes in the beginning
   and large changes towards the end.

   At 1, the keys will follow an "ease out" curve, with large value changes in the beginning
   and small changes towards the end.

   At 0, nothing changes.


.. _bpy.ops.graph.match_slope:

Match Slope
-----------

.. reference::

   :Menu:      :menuselection:`Key --> Blend --> Match Slope`

Blends the selected keys towards a straight line going through two keys just outside the current selection.

selected key.

Factor
   At 0, the keys will lie on the straight line.

   At 1, they keep their original values.

   At 2, each key's value will be twice as far from the straight line as before.

.. _bpy.ops.graph.shear:

Shear Keys
----------

.. reference::

   :Menu:      :menuselection:`Key --> Blend --> Shear Keys`

Shears the selected keyframes -- that is, changes their value by an amount that increases
as they get further away in time from a reference keyframe. By default, this reference keyframe
is the leftmost selected one, but you can instead use the rightmost one by pressing :kbd:`D`.

Shear Factor
   How much to shear. Negative values move keyframes downwards, while positive ones move them up.
Direction
   Whether to use the leftmost or the rightmost selected keyframe as a reference.


.. _bpy.ops.graph.scale_average:

Scale Average
-------------

.. reference::

   :Menu:      :menuselection:`Key --> Blend --> Scale Average`

Scales the selected keyframes vertically, using their average value as the pivot.

Factor
   At 0, the keyframes will all have the average value.

   At 1, they keep their original values.

   At 2, each keyframe's value will be twice as far from the average as before.


.. _bpy.ops.graph.scale_from_neighbor:

Scale from Neighbor
-------------------

.. reference::

   :Menu:      :menuselection:`Key --> Blend --> Scale from Neighbor`

Scales the selected keyframes vertically, using a keyframe just outside the selection as
the pivot. By default, this is the neighbor to the left of the selection,
but you can instead use the right one by pressing :kbd:`D`.

Factor
   The scale factor to apply.
Reference Key
   Whether to use the left or right neighbor as the pivot.


.. _bpy.ops.graph.time_offset:

Time Offset
-----------

.. reference::

   :Menu:      :menuselection:`Key --> Blend --> Time Offset`

Shifts the values of the selected keyframes so that the resulting F-Curve appears to move in time.
Works best with dense keyframes.

As the curve leaves the selected keyframes' time range on one end, it wraps back in on the other,
offset vertically so that the ends connect and there is no jump.

Frame Offset
   By how many frames to shift the F-Curve. The slider is limited to the range -10 ... 10,
   but you can type larger numbers too.


Smooth
======

.. reference::

   :Menu:      :menuselection:`Key --> Smooth`
   :Shortcut:  :kbd:`Alt-S`

.. _bpy.ops.graph.gaussian_smooth:

Smooth (Gaussian)
-----------------

.. reference::

   :Menu:      :menuselection:`Key --> Smooth --> Smooth (Gaussian)`

Smooths the selected keyframes using a Gaussian kernel. Click the menu item, move the mouse left or right to
adjust the strength, and click :kbd:`LMB` to confirm (or :kbd:`RMB` to cancel).

Factor
   How strongly the smoothing should be applied.

Sigma
   The shape of the gaussian distribution. Lower values mean a sharper curve, giving keys that are close to each
   other more weight. A high value behaves like a simple average filter.

Filter Width
   A wider filter looks at more keyframes, producing a smoother result.
   At a width of 1, the filter only looks at the keyframes to the immediate left and right for a weighted average.

.. figure:: /images/editors_graph-editor_gaussian_smooth.jpg

   F-Curve after applying the Gaussian Smooth with the original curve overlayed.

Smooth (Legacy)
---------------

.. reference::

   :Menu:      :menuselection:`Key --> Smooth --> Smooth (Legacy)`
   :Shortcut:  :kbd:`Alt-O`

There is also an option to smooth the selected curves, but beware: its algorithm seems to be
to halve the distance between each keyframe and the average linear value of the curve,
which gives quite a strong smoothing! Note that the first and last keys
seem to be never modified by this tool.

Butterworth Smooth
------------------

.. reference::

   :Menu:      :menuselection:`Key --> Smooth --> Butterworth Smooth`

Smooth the selected keyframes using a Butterworth filter. Click the menu item,
move the mouse left or right to adjust the frequency,
and click :kbd:`LMB` to confirm (or :kbd:`RMB` to cancel).

This filter is ideal for smoothing large amounts of data because it preserves the peaks
of the animation. The downside is that it can introduce a ripple effect when the key
values change rapidly.

Frequency Cutoff
   The lower the value, the smoother the curve. There is an implicit maximum at which
   the value no longer changes the curve, which is at half the sample rate. The sample
   rate in this case is the scene frame rate multiplied by the **Samples per Frame** of this operator.
Filter order
   Higher values mean the frequency cutoff is steeper.
Samples per Frame
   Before the filter is applied, the curve is resampled at this interval to avoid errors when there
   are uneven spaces between frames. If keys are on subframes, e.g. a 60fps file in a 30fps scene,
   increase this value to 2.
Blend
   A value between 0 and 1 for blending between the original curve and the smoothed one.
Blend In/Out
   The number of frames at the start and end for which to blend between the original and smoothed curve.
   This can help reduce jumps in the animation at the selection border. At value 1, it only locks the first and
   last frames of the selection to their original values.

## Introduction


************
Introduction
************

Blender lets you animate almost any property, going from the X coordinate of an object to the
transparency of a material. The evolution of a property's value over time is described by
a *function curve*, or F-Curve for short.

An important aspect of F-Curves is that they can interpolate. This saves you the effort of
manually configuring a value on every single frame, which would be highly impractical.
Instead, you define just a few values on key frames, and let the curve calculate the
values on all the other frames.

.. figure:: /images/editors_graph-editor_fcurves_introduction_f-curves-concept.png
   :align: right
   :width: 200px

   Example of interpolation.

The example curve on the right has two such keyframes (indicated by black dots):
one on frame 0 with value 0, and another on frame 25 with value 10.
The curve automatically calculates the values for the other frames,
such as for frame 5 where the value is 2.


Direction of Time
=================

F-Curves are similar to :doc:`Curve objects </modeling/curves/introduction>` in that they interpolate
between a set of user-defined control points. However, because their purpose is to define a *single*
value on every frame, there's an important difference: F-curves can't be closed or otherwise made to
turn back on themselves. They always continue going further to the right.

If you try to make a curve go left by dragging one control point past another,
it switches the order of the points to prevent this.

.. list-table:: Two control points switching: the curve cannot go back in time!

When the *Cycle Mode* for both ends is set to either *Repeat Motion* or
*Repeat with Offset*, and no other options of the modifier are
changed from their defaults, it defines a simple infinite cycle.

This special case receives some additional support from other areas of Blender:

- Automatic Bézier handle placement is aware of the cycle and adjusts to achieve a smooth transition.
- The :ref:`Cycle-Aware Keying <timeline-keying>` option can be enabled to take
  the cycle into account when inserting new keyframes.


.. index:: F-Curve Modifiers; Noise Modifier
.. _bpy.types.FModifierNoise:

Noise Modifier
--------------

Modifies the curve with a noise formula.
This is useful for adding subtle or extreme randomness to animated movements,
like camera shake.

Blend Type
   :Replace: Adds noise in the range [-0.5, 0.5].
   :Add: Adds noise in the range [0, 1].
   :Subtract: Subtracts noise in the range [0, 1].
   :Multiply: Multiplies by noise in the range [0, 1].

Scale
   Changes the horizontal scale of the noise. Higher values make for less dense oscillation.
Strength
   Changes the vertical scale of the noise.
Offset
   Offsets the noise in time.
Phase
   Adjusts the random seed of the noise.
Depth
   Adjusts how detailed the noise function is.


.. index:: F-Curve Modifiers; Limits Modifier
.. _bpy.types.FModifierLimits:

Limits Modifier
---------------

Limits the curve to specific time and value ranges.

Minimum, Maximum X
   Removes the original curve data to the left of the minimum frame and to the right of the maximum,
   replacing it by :ref:`Constant extrapolation <bpy.ops.graph.extrapolation_type>`.
Minimum, Maximum Y
   Clamps the curve values, never letting them go below the minimum or above the maximum.


.. index:: F-Curve Modifiers; Stepped Interpolation Modifier
.. _bpy.types.FModifierStepped:

Stepped Interpolation Modifier
------------------------------

Gives the curve a stepped appearance by sampling it every N frames and making it hold its value
after each sample. In a sense, this lowers the curve's frame rate by letting it change its value
less frequently, producing choppy movement as a result.

Step Size
   The number of frames to hold each step.
Offset
   The number of frames to offset the sample points.
Start Frame
   The frame where to start applying the effect.
End Frame
   The frame where to stop applying the effect.

Active F-Curve
==============

.. reference::

   :Panel:     :menuselection:`Sidebar region --> F-Curve --> Active F-Curve`

.. figure:: /images/editors_graph-editor_fcurves_sidebar_curve_active-fcurve-panel.png

   Active F-Curve panel.

This panel displays properties for the active F-Curve.

Channel Name
   The name of the property that's animated by the curve.

.. _bpy.types.FCurve.data_path:

Data Path
   The programmatic path to the property.

.. _bpy.types.FCurve.array_index:

RNA Array Index
   The index into the property, for multi-value properties. As an example, the Location
   property has three values (X, Y and Z), which means it can have three different curves
   with indices 0, 1 and 2.

.. _bpy.types.FCurve.color_mode:

Display Color
   How to determine the color of the F-Curve in the Graph editor.

   Auto Rainbow
      Assigns a unique color to each curve that uses this setting.
   Auto XYZ to RGB
      Detects curves that animate an X/Y/Z coordinate and colors them red/green/blue accordingly.
   User Defined
      Lets you choose the color yourself.

.. _bpy.types.FCurve.auto_smoothing:

Handle Smoothing
   How to compute the :ref:`Bézier handles <editors-graph-fcurves-settings-handles>`
   when using the *Automatic* or *Auto Clamped* handle type.

   .. figure:: /images/editors_graph-editor_fcurves_sidebar_curve_auto-smoothing.png
      :align: center

      Handle smoothing mode comparison.

   None
      Only directly adjacent key values are considered when computing the handles.

      This older method is very simple and predictable, but it can only produce
      truly smooth curves in the most trivial cases. Notice that the red curve
      in the image above has a few kinks in the middle.

   Continuous Acceleration
      A system of equations is solved in order to avoid or minimize jumps in acceleration
      at every keyframe.

      It produces much smoother curves out of the box, but necessarily means that
      any changes in the key values may affect interpolation over a significant stretch
      of the curve; although the amount of change decays exponentially with distance.
      This change propagation is stopped by any key with *Free*, *Aligned*, or *Vector*
      handles, as well as by extremes with *Auto Clamped* handles.

      The mode also tends to overshoot and oscillate more with fully *Automatic* handles
      in some cases (see the image above). So it is recommended to use *Auto Clamped* by default,
      and only switch to *Automatic* handles in places where this is desired behavior.
      That effect can also be reduced by adding in-between keys.

      .. tip::

         Considering the upsides and downsides of each mode, *Continuous Acceleration* should be
         better suited for limited animation, which uses a small number of interpolated keys with
         minimal manual polish. In case of highly polished high key rate animation, the benefits of
         smoothing may not outweigh the workflow disruption from more extensive change propagation.


Active Keyframe
===============

.. reference::

   :Panel:     :menuselection:`Sidebar region --> F-Curve --> Active Keyframe`

.. figure:: /images/editors_graph-editor_fcurves_sidebar_curve_active-keyframe-panel.png

   Active Keyframe panel.

.. _bpy.types.Keyframe.interpolation:
.. _editors-graph-fcurves-settings-interpolation:

Interpolation
   The :term:`interpolation` to use between the active keyframe and the next.


   .. rubric:: Interpolation

   :Constant:
      .. figure:: /images/editors_graph-editor_fcurves_introduction_constant.png
         :align: right
         :width: 300px

         Constant.

      The curve holds the value until the next keyframe, producing a stair step effect with
      very abrupt changes.
      Normally only used during the initial "blocking" stage in pose-to-pose animation workflows.

   :Linear:
      .. figure:: /images/editors_graph-editor_fcurves_introduction_linear.png
         :align: right
         :width: 300px

         Linear.

      The curve goes from one keyframe to the next in a straight line, which prevents abrupt
      changes in value but not in speed. By creating two keyframes with Linear interpolation
      and :ref:`extrapolation <bpy.ops.graph.extrapolation_type>`, you can easily make a straight
      line curve that goes on forever.

   :Bézier:
      .. figure:: /images/editors_graph-editor_fcurves_editing_clean1.png
         :align: right
         :width: 300px

         Bézier.

      The default interpolation, which is smooth in both values and speed.

   .. note::

      F-Curves for properties that only accept discrete values will always have a stair step pattern,
      no matter which option you chose.


   .. rubric:: Easing (by strength)

   A set of interpolations that specialize in accelerating or decelerating an value,
   "easing" it from a stationary into a moving state or vice versa.

   .. seealso::

      For more info and a few live demos,
      see `easings.net <https://easings.net>`__ and
      `Robert Penner's Easing Functions <http://robertpenner.com/easing>`__.


   .. rubric:: Dynamic Effects

   These additional easing types imitate (fake) physics-based effects like bouncing.

   Back
      With *Ease In*, the value first moves away from the target and then shoots towards it.
      With *Ease Out*, it goes towards the target, overshoots it, and then returns.

      Back
         The size and direction (i.e. above/below the curve) of the overshoot.

   Bounce
      Makes the value bounce a few times with exponential decay,
      like a tennis ball that was dropped on the floor.

   Elastic
      Makes the value overshoot the target, then rebound and undershoot it,
      then overshoot it again... with ever-decreasing intensity until it eventually settles.

      Amplitude
         How far the value initially overshoots its target.
      Period
         How much time there is between each oscillation.

.. _editors-graph-fcurves-settings-easing:

Easing
   This option only applies to the *Easing* and *Dynamic Effects* categories above.

   Automatic Easing
      Automatically pick the most commonly used type: *Ease In* when using one of the *Easing* interpolations,
      and *Ease Out* when using one of the *Dynamic Effects*.
   Ease In
      The value accelerates, moving slowly at the beginning of the curve segment and speeding up towards the end.
   Ease Out
      The value decelerates, moving quickly at the beginning of the curve segment and slowing down towards the end.
   Ease In Out
      The value moves slowly in the beginning, speeds up towards the middle, and slows down again towards the end.

.. _bpy.types.Keyframe.co_ui:

Key Frame
   The frame of the active keyframe.
Value
   The value of the active keyframe.

.. _bpy.types.Keyframe.handle_left_type:
.. _bpy.types.Keyframe.handle_right_type:
.. _editors-graph-fcurves-settings-handles:

Left/Right Handle Type
   When the keyframe's interpolation is set to *Bézier*, the shape of the curve around it is
   influenced by its handles. Each handle has its own type which determines if (and how) Blender
   positions it automatically, and if not, how much freedom you have in positioning it manually.

   You can change the handles' types in multiple ways: using these dropdowns in the Sidebar;
   through the menu :menuselection:`Key --> Handle Type`; or by pressing :kbd:`V` and selecting from the popup menu.

   If you want to change an automatic handle's position, just drag it;
   you don't need to manually change its type first.

   :Automatic:
      .. figure:: /images/editors_graph-editor_fcurves_introduction_auto.png
         :align: right
         :width: 300px

         Auto handles.

      Automatic handles that produce smooth curves.

   :Auto Clamped:
      .. figure:: /images/editors_graph-editor_fcurves_introduction_autoclamped.png
         :align: right
         :width: 300px

         Auto clamped handles.

      Automatic handles clamped to prevent overshoots and
      changes in the curve direction between keyframes (S-shapes).

   :Vector:
      .. figure:: /images/editors_graph-editor_fcurves_introduction_vector.png
         :align: right
         :width: 300px

         Vector handles.

      Automatic handles that produce straight curve segments (like linear interpolation).

   :Aligned:
      .. figure:: /images/editors_graph-editor_fcurves_introduction_aligned.png
         :align: right
         :width: 300px

         Aligned handles.

      Manual handles, which are however locked together to always point in opposite directions.
      This results in a curve that is always smooth at the control point.

   :Free:
      .. figure:: /images/editors_graph-editor_fcurves_introduction_free.png
         :align: right
         :width: 300px

         Free handles.

      Manual handles that can be moved independently, and thus can result in a sharp change of direction.


   .. _bpy.types.Keyframe.handle_left:
   .. _bpy.types.Keyframe.handle_right:

   Frame, Value
      The frame and value for the left/right handle of the active keyframe.

For options, see `Movie`_ below.


Movie
-----

A video file. Note that if you want to do motion tracking and video compositing
rather than simply using the video as a texture, you should load it into the
:doc:`Movie Clip Editor </editors/clip/introduction>` instead.

.. note::

   The options below are for preview purposes only; they don't affect the 3D Viewport
   or the render. For that, see the :doc:`/render/shader_nodes/textures/image`.

.. note::

   Blender plays all videos at the scene framerate, not their original framerate,
   meaning they'll be faster or slower than intended if these framerates don't match up.
   To work around this, see the *Offset* field of the Image Texture Node
   linked above.

Frames
   How many frames of the video to play. Past this point, the video will be paused
   (unless *Cyclic* is enabled).

   .. _bpy.ops.image.match_movie_length:

   Match Movie Length
      Sets the *Frames* to the number of frames in the video file.

Start
   Scene frame at which the video should start playing.

Offset
   Number of frames to offset the video to an earlier point in time.
   (Put differently: how many frames at the start of the video to skip.)

Cyclic
   Start over after the last frame to create a continuous loop.

Auto Refresh
   Play the video in the Image Editor when the scene animation is playing.
   (The mouse cursor should be in the Image Editor or the Timeline when starting playback
   for this to work.)

Deinterlace
   Apply deinterlacing to interlaced (analog) video.


.. _image-generated:

Generated
---------

Image generated by Blender.

X, Y
   The width and height of the image in pixels.
Float Buffer
   Creates a 32-bit image. This has a larger file size,
   but holds much more color information than the standard 8-bit image.
   For close-ups and large gradients, it may be better to use a 32-bit image.
Type
   :Blank: Creates a blank image of a single specified color.
   :UV Grid: Creates a checkerboard pattern with a colored cross (+) in each square.
   :Color Grid:
      Creates a more complex colored grid with letters and numbers denoting locations.
      It could be used to check for stretching or distortion in the UV mapping.
Color
   The fill color when creating a *Blank* image.

Common Options
==============

.. _bpy.types.Image.filepath:

File
   Used for replacing or packing files.

   Pack
      Embed the resource into the current blend-file. See :doc:`/files/blend/packed_data`.
   Path
      Path to the linked file.
   Open
      Opens the :doc:`/editors/file_browser` to select a file from a drive.
   Reload
      Reloads the file. Useful when it has been reworked in an external application.

.. _bpy.types.Image.is_multiview:

Use Multi-View
   See :doc:`Multi-View </render/output/properties/stereoscopy/index>`.

.. _bpy.types.ColorManagedInputColorspaceSettings.name:

Color Space
   The :term:`Color Space` the image file was saved in. This is used for converting
   the image to linear color (which is the color space Blender works with).

   Textures and final renders are often stored in sRGB,
   while OpenEXR images are stored in a linear color space.
   Some images such as normal, bump or stencil maps do not strictly contain "colors"
   and should never have a color conversion applied to them.
   For such images, the color space should be set to *Non-Color*.

   The list of color spaces depends on the active :ref:`OCIO config <ocio-config>`.
   The default supported color spaces are described in detail here:
   :ref:`Default OpenColorIO Configuration <ocio-config-default-color-spaces>`.

.. _bpy.types.Image.alpha_mode:

Alpha
   How the image uses its :term:`Alpha Channel`.
   This option is only available if the image format supports transparency.

   :Straight:
      Store RGB and alpha channels separately with alpha acting as a mask, also known as unassociated alpha.
      Commonly used by image editing applications and file formats like PNG.
      This preserves colors in parts of the image with zero alpha.
   :Premultiplied:
      Store RGB channels with alpha multiplied in, also known as associated alpha.
      The natural format for renders and used by file formats like OpenEXR.
      This can represent purely emissive effects like fire correctly, unlike straight alpha.
   :Channel Packed:
      Different images are packed in the RGB and alpha channels, and they should not affect each other.
      Channel packing is commonly used by game engines to save memory.
   :None:
      Ignore alpha channel from the file and make image fully opaque.

.. _bpy.types.Image.use_half_precision:

Half Float Precision
   Load the image with a :term:`bit depth` of only 16 bits per channel instead of 32, which saves memory.

.. _bpy.types.Image.use_view_as_render:

View as Render
   Apply the :ref:`color management <render-post-color-management>` settings when displaying this image on the screen.

.. _bpy.types.Image.seam_margin:

Seam Margin
   The thickness of the margin around UV islands for texture painting to bleed into. This margin ensures that
   no unpainted pixels remain at the island border.

   .. figure:: /images/editors_image_image-settings_seam-margin.png

      Painting a stroke across a seam in 3D space makes it extend past the UV island borders in the texture,
      until it gets cut off at the margin.

   A higher value will result in a thicker margin, which can be useful if you intend to create mipmaps
   of the texture. However, this may also reduce painting performance.

   .. note::

      This setting only affects Sculpt Mode, where texture painting support is currently experimental.
      In Texture Paint Mode, a fixed margin is used instead.

   .. TODO
      Remove the above "is currently experimental" once these tickets get resolved:
      https://projects.blender.org/blender/blender/issues/96225
      https://projects.blender.org/blender/blender/issues/97352
      Also, the setting appears broken at the time of writing this comment: strokes don't actually
      get cut off, regardless of the margin value (had to cheat and edit the Blender source code to get it
      to work). Best retest it once it comes out of Experimental state and create a ticket if needed.

************
Introduction
************

The Image Editor lets you create, view, and edit images,
as well as see render results and intermediate
:doc:`Compositor </compositing/introduction>` output.

.. figure:: /images/editors_image_introduction_main.png

   Image Editor with a test grid texture.


Toolbar
=======

Sample
   Used to sample the color of one or more pixels in the image.
   As long as you hold :kbd:`LMB`, the footer will show the following:

   - X and Y coordinates of the mouse cursor.
   - Color in RGBA.
   - Color in RGB after :doc:`/render/color_management`.
   - Color in HSV.
   - Luminance.

   Sample Size
      The dimensions of the square used to sample underlying pixels.
      If larger than 1, the resulting sample is an average of all underlying pixels.

Annotate
   See :doc:`Annotations </interface/annotate_tool>` for more information.


Header
======

Mode
   :View: Displays images.
   :Paint: :doc:`/sculpt_paint/texture_paint/index`.
   :Mask: :doc:`/movie_clip/masking/index`.

View
   Tools for controlling how the content is displayed in the editor.
   See :doc:`/editors/image/navigating`.

Image
   Tools for opening and manipulating images. Shows an asterisk if the image
   has unsaved changes. See :doc:`/editors/image/editing`.

Image
   A :ref:`data-block menu <ui-data-block>` used for selecting images.
   Once an image is selected, the :doc:`Image tab </editors/image/image_settings>`
   appears in the Sidebar region.

   Apart from loading existing images, you can also create new ones:

   .. figure:: /images/editors_image_image-settings_generated-new-image.png

      The pop-over that's displayed when clicking "New Image" in the header.

   The *Tiled* option creates an image with support for
   :doc:`/modeling/meshes/uv/workflows/udims`. For the other options, see
   :ref:`Generated Images <image-generated>`.

   In addition to images, the data-block selector includes the following items:

   - Render Result: displays renders. When this item is selected, the *Slot*,
     *View Layer*, and *Render Pass* selectors become available (see below).
   - Viewer Node: displays the image that's fed into the
     :doc:`/compositing/types/output/viewer` in the Compositor.

Image Pin
   Prevents the Image Editor from automatically switching to the texture of
   the selected object. (This switching only happens if the 3D Viewport is
   in :doc:`Texture Paint </sculpt_paint/texture_paint/introduction>` mode).

Slot
   The render slot to view (and render to). You can create new renders without
   losing previous ones by selecting an empty slot before rendering. Afterwards,
   you compare them by pressing :kbd:`J` and :kbd:`Alt-J` to cycle forwards and backwards.
   Alternatively, you can use the number keys :kbd:`1`, :kbd:`2`, :kbd:`3` etc.
   to select the slot with the corresponding number.

   Slots can be renamed by double clicking their name in the Image panel in the Sidebar.

View Layer
   The :doc:`View Layer </render/layers/introduction>` to display.

Render Pass
   The :doc:`Render Pass </render/layers/passes>` to display.

.. _bpy.types.SpaceImageEditor.show_gizmo:

Viewport Gizmos
   Lets you show/hide all gizmos using the toggle button, or specific gizmos using
   the drop-down arrow.

   .. _bpy.types.SpaceImageEditor.show_gizmo_navigate:

   Navigate
      Enable/disable the gizmos used to pan or zoom the 2D viewport.
      See :ref:`Navigation Gizmos <editors-image-navigate-gizmos>` for more information.

.. _bpy.types.SpaceImageEditor.display_channels:

Display Channels
   Select which color channels are displayed.

   :Color & Alpha:
      Enables transparency and shows a checkerboard behind the image.
   :Color:
      Disables transparency.
   :Alpha:
      Displays the alpha channel as a grayscale image. White areas are opaque,
      black areas are transparent.
   :Z-Buffer:
      Displays the depth from the camera, from Clip Start to Clip End,
      as specified in the :doc:`Camera settings </render/cameras>`.
   :Red, Green, Blue:
      Single color channel visualized as a grayscale image.


Main View
=========

Holding :kbd:`RMB` will sample the image just like the Sample tool,
except it will always sample only one pixel.


## Navigating


**********

   Adjust the :doc:`area </interface/window_system/areas>` the Image Editor is in.


## Overlays


********
Overlays
********

The Overlays pop-over configures the overlays that are displayed on top of images.
In the header, there is a button to turn off all overlays for the Image Editor.
This option also toggles the visibility of :doc:`UDIM </modeling/meshes/uv/workflows/udims>`
tile information.

The options that are visible in the pop-over depend on the Image Editor mode.
The following overlay categories are available:

Geometry
========

Display Texture Paint UVs
   Display the active object's UVs. The Image Editor must be in Paint mode, and the active object
   must be in Texture Paint Mode or Edit Mode for the UVs to be visible.

## Introduction

.. index:: Editors; NLA Editor

************
Introduction
************

The NonLinear Animation editor, or NLA editor for short, lets you animate on a higher level.
Instead of working with individual keyframes, it works with :doc:`actions </animation/actions>`,
which are named, reusable animation segments.

.. figure:: /images/editors_nla_introduction_example.png

   The NLA editor.


Main Region
===========

The editor displays a stack of :doc:`tracks </editors/nla/tracks>` which work like layers in an image editing
program. Higher tracks take precedence over lower ones, although you can also choose to blend them.

Each track can contain any number of :doc:`strips </editors/nla/strips>` -- typically Action Strips,
which are instances of actions.

The top track hilighted in orange is special: this is the Action Track. Unlike the other tracks,
it doesn't contain strips -- instead, it contains the object's *active action*,
which is where new keyframes are added to by default.

Editors like the :doc:`Timeline </editors/timeline>` and the
:doc:`Dope Sheet Editor </editors/dope_sheet/introduction>`
normally only show the keyframes of this active action. If you want to edit another action,
you can select it in the NLA editor and press :kbd:`Tab` to enter Tweak Mode.

.. figure:: /images/editors_nla_introduction_tweak-mode.png

   Tweaking an action. Notice that it's shown in both its original track and the Action Track.
   The active action is temporarily hidden.


Header
======

View Menu
---------

Sidebar :kbd:`N`
   Shows or hides the :ref:`Sidebar Region <ui-region-sidebar>`.
Adjust Last Operation
   Displays a pop-up panel to alter properties of the last
   completed operation. See :ref:`bpy.ops.screen.redo_last`.
Channels
   Shows or hides the Track Region.

----------

Frame Selected :kbd:`NumpadPeriod`
   Pans and zooms the view to focus on the selected strips.
Frame All :kbd:`Home`
   Pans and zooms the view to show all strips.
Go to Current Frame :kbd:`Numpad0`
   Centers the view on the Playhead.

----------

Realtime Updates
   Whether to update other views (such as the 3D Viewport) while you're moving strips around.
   If disabled, the other views only get updated once you finish the move.
Show Control F-Curves
   Shows a graph on top of each strip that uses :ref:`Animated Influence <bpy.types.NlaStrip.influence>`.

----------

Show Markers
   Shows the marker region (provided any markers have been defined).
   When disabled, the `Marker Menu`_ is also hidden and marker operators are not available in this editor.
Show Local Markers
   Shows action-local markers (which you can create in the :ref:`Action Editor <dopesheet-marker-menu>`).
   This can be useful to align strips to each other.

   .. figure:: /images/editors_nla_tracks_local_markers.png

      Local markers shown in the NLA Editor (top) and the Action Editor (bottom).
Show Seconds :kbd:`Ctrl-T`
   Shows timing in seconds instead of frames.
Sync Visible Range
   Synchronizes the horizontal panning and scale of the editor
   with other time-based editors that also have this option enabled.
   That way, they always show the same section of time.

----------

Set Preview Range :kbd:`P`
   Lets you drag a box to define a time range for previewing. As long as this range is active,
   playback will be limited to it, letting you repeatedly view a segment of the animation without
   having to manually rewind each time.

   You can change the start or end frame using the corresponding button in the
   Timeline editor's :ref:`Playback <timeline-playback>` popover.
   Alternatively, you can simply run *Set Preview Range* again.
Clear Preview Range :kbd:`Alt-P`
   Clears the preview range.
Set Preview Range to Selected :kbd:`Ctrl-Alt-P`
   Applies a preview range that encompasses the selected strips.


----------

Area
   Area controls. See the :doc:`user interface </interface/window_system/areas>`
   documentation for more information.


Select Menu
-----------

All :kbd:`A`
   Selects all strips.
None :kbd:`Alt-A`
   Deselects all strips.
Invert :kbd:`Ctrl-I`
   Inverts the current selection.

----------

:ref:`Box Select <bpy.ops.*.select_box>` :kbd:`B`
   Lets you drag a box and selects the strips that are partially or completely inside it.
Box Select (Axis Range) :kbd:`Alt-B`
   Lets you drag a box and selects the strips that overlap the corresponding time range,
   even if they're above or below the box.

----------

Before Current Frame :kbd:`[`
   Selects all the strips that start before (or on) the current frame.
After Current Frame :kbd:`]`
   Selects all the strips that end after (or on) the current frame.


Marker Menu
-----------

:doc:`Markers </animation/markers>` are used to denote frames with key points or significant events
within an animation. Like with most animation editors, they're shown at the bottom.

.. figure:: /images/editors_graph-editor_introduction_markers.png

   Markers in animation editor.

For descriptions of the different marker tools, see :ref:`Editing Markers <animation-markers-editing>`.


Add Menu
--------

Action :kbd:`Shift-A`
   Adds a strip referencing an action to the active track.
Transition :kbd:`Shift-T`
   Adds a transition strip between the two selected action strips.
Sound :kbd:`Shift-K`
   Adds a strip that controls when the :doc:`/render/output/audio/speaker` object plays its sound clip.

----------

.. _bpy.ops.nla.selected_objects_add:

Selected Objects
   Makes the selected objects appear in the NLA Editor without adding an action or track to them.

See :doc:`/editors/nla/strips` for details on the various strip types.

Track Menu
----------

Contains tools for working with NLA tracks.
See :doc:`Editing Tracks </editors/nla/editing/track>` for details.


Strip Menu
----------

Contains tools for working with NLA strips.
See :doc:`Editing Strips </editors/nla/editing/strip>` for details.

Filters
-------

Only Show Selected
   Only shows tracks belonging to objects that are selected.
Show Hidden
   Shows tracks from objects that are hidden.
Include Missing NLA
   Shows the Action Track even if there is no action in it.
Search
   Filters the track list by a search term.
Filtering Collection
   Select a collection to only show tracks from objects in that collection.
Filter by Type
   Filter tracks by target type.
Sort Data-Blocks
   Sorts data-blocks alphabetically to make them easier to find.

   If your playback speed suffers because of this
   (should only really be an issue when working with lots of objects),
   you can turn it off.

Snap
----

The toggle button enables/disables automatic strip snapping.
The dropdown button shows a popover with the following options:

Snap To
   Type of element to snap to.

   :Frame: Snap to full frames.
   :Second: Snap to seconds.
   :Nearest Marker: Snap to the nearest :doc:`Marker </animation/markers>`.

Absolute Time Snap
   When disabled, strips will move in increments of *Snap To*.
   For example, if you selected *Second* and have a strip that currently
   starts on 0:06+5, dragging it to the right will snap it to 0:07+5. Its time
   increases by a second, and its subsecond offset of 5 frames remains the same.

   When enabled, strips will snap to multiples of *Snap To*.
   Taking the above example, the strip would snap to 0:07+0,
   removing the subsecond offset.

Edited Action
=============

.. reference::

   :Panel:     :menuselection:`Sidebar --> Edited Action`

.. figure:: /images/editors_nla_sidebar_animation-data-panel.png

   Edited Action panel.

Contains settings for the object's active action. Only visible if the
:ref:`Action Track <nla-action-track>` is selected.

Action
   A :ref:`data-block <ui-data-block>` menu where you can see, change, and clear the object's active action.
   See also the Action Editor's :ref:`Action <dopesheet-action-action>`.

.. _bpy.types.AnimData.action_extrapolation:

Extrapolation
   Determines whether the action will influence the frames before/after its boundaries
   once it has been pushed down into a strip. (As long as it's still the active action,
   *Hold* is used regardless of the choice.)

   Hold
      The property values at the action's first keyframe also apply to the earlier frames
      (if the strip is the first in the track). The values at its last keyframe also
      apply to the later frames (up to the next strip).
   Hold Forward
      The property values at the action's last keyframe also apply to the later frames
      (up to the next strip).
   Nothing
      The animated properties return to their default values outside of the strip boundaries.

.. _bpy.types.AnimData.action_blend_type:

Blending
   How to combine the action's property values with those of the tracks below.

   Replace
      Overwrites the values produced by the lower tracks. If *Influence* is less than 1,
      a linear interpolation between the previous and new values is used instead.
   Multiply, Subtract, Add
      Blends the action's values with those of the lower tracks using a simple calculation.
      If *Influence* is less than 1, a linear interpolation between the previous values
      and these calculated values is used.

      :math:`result = mix(previous, previous (+-×) value, influence)`
   Combine
      Depending on the type of each property, one of the following methods is automatically chosen:

      Axis/Angle Rotation
         :math:`result = previous + value × influence`

         This results in averaging the axis and adding the amount of rotation.
      Quaternion Rotation
         Quaternion math is applied to all four channels of the property at once:

         :math:`result = {previous} × {value} ^ {influence}`
      Proportional (Scale)
         :math:`result = previous × (value / default) ^ {influence}`
      Others
         :math:`result = previous + (value - default) × {influence}`

      .. note::

         Since this blending mode uses quaternion multiplication to calculate
         the Quaternion Rotation properties, it always drives all four channels during playback,
         and *Insert Single Keyframe* is forced to insert all four keys.
         Other types of channels can still be keyed individually.

.. _bpy.types.AnimData.action_influence:

Influence
   How much the action contributes to the result of the NLA stack.


Strip
=====

Name
   Name of the strip.

.. _bpy.types.NlaStrip.mute:

Mute (checkbox)
   When unchecked, the strip will no longer contribute to the animation.
   It's shown with a dotted outline to indicate this.


Active Strip
------------

.. reference::

   :Panel:     :menuselection:`Sidebar --> Strip --> Active Strip`

.. figure:: /images/editors_nla_sidebar_active-strip-panel.png

   Active Strip panel.

Contains common strip properties.

Frame Start
   The frame where the strip begins. Changing this will move the strip while
   keeping its duration constant.

Frame End
   The frame where the strip ends. Changing this will also change the *Action Clip Frame End*,
   thereby cropping or extending the action. If you instead want to speed it up or slow it down,
   scale it by using :menuselection:`Strip --> Transform --> Scale`
   or adjusting the *Playback Scale* setting.

Extrapolation
   See :ref:`Extrapolation <bpy.types.AnimData.action_extrapolation>`.

Blending
   See :ref:`Blending <bpy.types.AnimData.action_blend_type>`.

Blend In, Out
   How many frames it takes for the strip's influence to ramp up at the start
   and wind down at the end.

.. figure:: /images/editors_nla_sidebar_active-strip_auto-blend.png
   :align: right

   Two strips with Auto Blend enabled.

Auto Blend In/Out
   Calculates *Blend In/Out* automatically by looking at the strips in the track
   above or below that overlap the current strip in time.

Playback
   Reversed
      Makes the strip play backwards.
   Cyclic Strip Time
      Whether to wrap the *Animated Strip Time* back to the start if it exceeds
      the Action Clip Frame End.

.. _bpy.types.NlaStrip.influence:

Animated Influence
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Lets you manually specify, and animate, how strongly the strip affects the animation.
This is an alternative to using the *(Auto) Blend In/Out* settings above.

To create an influence keyframe, first type a value, then either click
:menuselection:`Insert Keyframe` in its context menu or press :kbd:`I`
while hovering over it. You can see the keyframes in e.g. the
:doc:`Graph Editor </editors/graph_editor/introduction>`.


Animated Strip Time
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Lets you manually specify, and animate, the frame at which the underlying action
is sampled.

.. note::

   Although the setting is called *Strip Time*, its value is a frame number
   inside the action, not inside the strip. If you have an action going
   from frame 1 to frame 50 that's referenced by a strip going from frame
   101 to 150, you'd set the *Strip Time* to 1 to see the first keyframe,
   not 101.

In combination with *Cyclic Strip Time*, this lets you play the
action's keyframes multiple times in a single strip.
As an example, say that the action's keyframes are between frames 1 and 50.
If you animate the strip time to instead go from 1 to 100,
the keyframes will play twice (at twice the speed).

In practice, however, it's easier to use the *Repeat* setting described below.

.. _nla-sidebar-action-clip:

Action Clip
-----------

.. reference::

   :Panel:     :menuselection:`Sidebar region --> Strip --> Action Clip`

.. figure:: /images/editors_nla_sidebar_action-clip-panel.png

   Action Clip panel.

Contains properties specific to Action strips.

Action
   The action referenced by the strip.

Frame Start, End
   How much of the action to use. By adjusting these, you can crop or extend the action
   (and the strip, as its *Frame End* will change accordingly).
   If you extend the action, :ref:`F-Curve Extrapolation <editors-graph-fcurves-settings-extrapolation>`
   will kick in.

   One case where these settings can be useful is in cyclic animation where the first
   and last keyframes of the action have the same value (meaning this value applies for
   two frames when the animation restarts). By reducing the *Frame End*, you can exclude
   the last keyframe and have the value apply for only one frame instead.

Sync Length
   Automatically sets *Frame Start/End* to the action's first/last keyframe when exiting
   Tweak Mode.

Now
   Sets *Frame Start/End* to the action's first/last keyframe.

Playback Scale
   Makes the animation play more quickly (scale < 1) or slowly (scale > 1) than the
   original action.

Repeat
   Makes the action play multiple times.


Action
------

.. reference::

   :Panel:     :menuselection:`Sidebar region --> Strip --> Action`

See :ref:`Action Properties <actions-properties>`.


Modifiers
=========

.. reference::

   :Panel:     :menuselection:`Sidebar region --> Modifiers`

Strip modifiers let you make non-destructive changes to all the curves inside
the strip's action.

See :doc:`F-Curve Modifiers </editors/graph_editor/fcurves/modifiers>`.


## Strips

.. _bpy.types.NlaStrip:

******
Strips
******

A strip tells the animation when something happens and for how long.
There are a few different types which are described below.


.. _bpy.ops.nla.actionclip_add:

Action Strips
=============

An action strip plays the keyframes inside an :doc:`action </animation/actions>`.
You can create one using :menuselection:`Add --> Action`. Another way is to click
:ref:`Push Down Action <bpy.ops.nla.action_pushdown>` in the NLA's Action Track --
this will create a strip based on the object's active action.

Multiple strips can reference the same action, so that you can potentially change
multiple parts of the animation by editing a single set of keyframes.

A strip can be shorter than its underlying action, be it through cropping,
speeding up, or both. It can also be longer than its underlying action,
be it through extending, slowing down, or both. See the
:ref:`Sidebar <nla-sidebar-action-clip>` for details.


.. _bpy.ops.nla.transition_add:

Transition Strips
=================

A transition strip interpolates between two neighboring action strips.
Select them and click :menuselection:`Add --> Transition`.

.. figure:: /images/editors_nla_strips_basics-transition.png

   Transition Strip.


.. _bpy.ops.nla.soundclip_add:

Sound Strips
============

These strips control when a :doc:`/render/output/audio/speaker` plays its sound clip.


Meta Strips
===========

A meta strip groups other strips together, letting you move, scale, and copy them as one combined unit.


## Tracks

.. _bpy.types.NlaTrack:

******
Tracks
******

A track plays one or more actions in sequence. You can create multiple tracks to play
several actions at the same time.

.. figure:: /images/editors_nla_tracks_example.png

   NLA Tracks and Strips.

The track region has the following properties:

Disable NLA stack (checkbox in blue object header)
   When unchecked, mutes all the tracks except the Action Track.
Track name
   Double-click to change. (Not possible for the Action Track, as this one simply displays the
   name of the action.)
Mute (checkbox in gray track header)
   When unchecked, the track stops contributing to the animation. Its strips receive a dotted outline
   to indicate this. Note that you can also mute individual strips.
Lock (padlock icon)
   Prevents changes from being made to this track.
   This is useful, for example, if you want to move the strips in all the tracks except for a few.
Solo (star icon)
   Mutes all other tracks, including the Action Track, so that only this track contributes
   to the animation. This is useful for inspecting the track without any distractions from others.

.. _nla-action-track:

Action Track
============

The topmost track with the orange header holds the action that's being edited. Normally this is the
object's active action, but if you select a strip and press :kbd:`Tab` to enter Tweak Mode,
you can temporarily make that one editable instead --
in the :doc:`Action Editor </editors/dope_sheet/modes/action>`
or the :doc:`Graph Editor </editors/graph_editor/introduction>`, for example.

The Action Track has one of the following buttons:

.. _bpy.ops.nla.action_pushdown:

Push Down Action
   Not available in Tweak Mode. Creates a new track below the Action Track and moves the active action
   into it as a strip, leaving the Action Track empty. (If you create a keyframe after this,
   Blender will automatically create a new active action to hold it.)

   .. figure:: /images/editors_nla_tracks_push-down-button.png

      Push Down Action button.

Pin
   Only available in Tweak Mode. When unchecked, the action's keyframes are shown at their original
   time points, rather than their new time points resulting from the strip being moved and scaled.

   .. figure:: /images/editors_nla_tracks_pin1.png

      Strip at its original time point.

   .. figure:: /images/editors_nla_tracks_pin2.png

      Strip moved. Notice that the keyframes are now shown to start at frame 20, which is also
      how the animation will behave. Within the action, however, they still start at frame 1.

   .. figure:: /images/editors_nla_tracks_pin3.png

      After unchecking the Pin icon, the keyframes are shown at their original time points.

Transform
=========

.. reference::

   :Editor:    Nonlinear Animation
   :Menu:      :menuselection:`Strip --> Transform`

Move :kbd:`G`
   Move the selected strips in time or to a different track.
Extend :kbd:`E`
   Lets you quickly move the selected strips that are on a certain side of the Playhead.
   This is handy if you need to, say, move all the strips after a certain time point to
   the right to make space for new ones.

   To use this operator, first select some or all strips and place your mouse cursor to
   the left or right of the Playhead. Then, press :kbd:`E`, move the mouse to move (only)
   the strips on that side of the Playhead, and press :kbd:`LMB` to confirm
   (or :kbd:`RMB` to cancel).

   If a strip straddles the Playhead, only its starting/ending point will be moved
   (again depending on the position of the mouse cursor).
Scale :kbd:`S`
   Scales the selected strips, using the Playhead as the pivot point.

Duplicate
=========

.. reference::

   :Editor:    Nonlinear Animation
   :Menu:      :menuselection:`Strip --> Duplicate`
   :Shortcut:  :kbd:`Alt-D`

Creates copies of the selected strips, duplicating any actions they reference.
Editing the keyframes in a copied strip therefore doesn't affect the original.

.. _bpy.ops.nla.duplicate_linked_move:

Linked Duplicate
================

.. reference::

   :Editor:    Nonlinear Animation
   :Menu:      :menuselection:`Strip --> Linked Duplicate`
   :Shortcut:  :kbd:`Shift-D`

Creates copies of the selected strips, reusing any actions they reference.
Editing the keyframes in a copied strip therefore also affects the original
(and vice versa). Blender warns you about this by hilighting the other strip in red.

.. figure:: /images/editors_nla_editing_linked-strip-edit.png

   Linked duplicated strip being edited.

   :Menu:      :menuselection:`Add --> Make Meta`
   :Shortcut:  :kbd:`Ctrl-G`

Groups the selected NLA-strips into a meta strip.

.. list-table::

   * - .. figure:: /images/editors_nla_strips_meta1.png
          :width: 320px

          Select two or more strips.

     - .. figure:: /images/editors_nla_strips_meta2.png
          :width: 320px

          Combine them into a meta strip.


.. _bpy.ops.nla.meta_remove:

===========

.. reference::

   :Editor:    Nonlinear Animation
   :Menu:      :menuselection:`Strip --> Remove Meta`
   :Shortcut:  :kbd:`Ctrl-Alt-G`

Ungroups the selected meta strips, replacing them by their contents.


.. _bpy.ops.nla.mute_toggle:

.. reference::

   :Editor:    Nonlinear Animation
   :Menu:      :menuselection:`Strip --> Toggle Muting`
   :Shortcut:  :kbd:`H`

Mutes or unmutes the selected strips. Muted strips have a dotted border and
don't influence the animation.


.. _bpy.ops.nla.bake:

Bake Action
===========

.. reference::

   :Editor:    Nonlinear Animation
   :Menu:      :menuselection:`Strip --> Bake Action`

.. reference::

   :Editor:    3D Viewport
   :Mode:      Object and Pose Modes
   :Menu:      :menuselection:`Header --> Object --> Animation --> Bake Action...`

The final motion of objects and bones depends not only on the keyframed animation,
but also on :doc:`F-Curve modifiers </editors/graph_editor/fcurves/modifiers>`,
:doc:`drivers </animation/drivers/introduction>`,
and :doc:`constraints </animation/constraints/introduction>`.
The *Bake Action* operator computes this final motion and creates a corresponding
keyframe on every scene frame.

This can be useful for adding deviation to a cyclic action like a :term:`Walk Cycle`,
or to create a keyframe animation from drivers or constraints.

Start Frame
   Start frame for baking.
End Frame
   End frame for baking.
Frame Step
   Number of frames to skip forward while baking each frame.
Only Selected Bones
   Only key selected bones (Pose baking only).
Visual Keying
   Keyframe from the final transformations (with constraints applied).
Clear Constraints
   Remove all constraints from keyed object/bones, and do 'visual' keying.
Clear Parents
   Bake animation onto the object then clear parents (objects only).
Overwrite Current Action
   Bake animation into the current action instead of creating a new one
   (useful for baking only part of bones in an armature).
Clean Curves
   After baking curves, :ref:`remove redundant keys <bpy.ops.graph.clean>`.
Bake Data
   Which data's transformations to bake.

   :Pose: Bake bone transformations.
   :Object: Bake object transformations.
Channels
   Which channels to bake.

   :Location: Bake location channels.
   :Rotation: Bake rotation channels.
   :Scale: Bake scale channels.
   :B-Bone: Bake :doc:`B-Bone </animation/armatures/bones/properties/bendy_bones>` channels.

   :Shortcut:  :kbd:`Ctrl-A`

Applies the scale of the selected strips to their referenced actions.


.. _bpy.ops.nla.clear_scale:

Clear Scale
===========

.. reference::

   :Editor:    Nonlinear Animation
   :Menu:      :menuselection:`Strip --> Clear Scale`
   :Shortcut:  :kbd:`Alt-S`

Resets the scale of the selected strips.


.. _bpy.ops.nla.action_sync_length:

Sync Action Length
==================

.. reference::

   :Editor:    Nonlinear Animation
   :Menu:      :menuselection:`Strip --> Sync Action Length`

Resets the strip's length to that of its underlying action,
ensuring that it (only) plays from the action's first keyframe to its last.

.. seealso::

   The Sync Length Now button in the :ref:`Sidebar <nla-sidebar-action-clip>`,
   which does the same thing.

.. _bpy.ops.nla.make_single_user:

Make Single User
================

.. reference::

   :Editor:    Nonlinear Animation
   :Menu:      :menuselection:`Strip --> Make Single User`
   :Shortcut:  :kbd:`U`

Duplicates actions where necessary so that each selected strip has its own action that's not used
by any others. This way, you can edit the keyframes in the selected strips knowing that you won't
affect any other part of the animation.

.. note::

   This does not recursively go inside meta strips.


.. _bpy.ops.nla.tweakmode_enter:

Start Editing Stashed Action
============================

.. reference::

   :Editor:    Nonlinear Animation
   :Menu:      :menuselection:`Strip --> Start Editing Stashed Action`
   :Shortcut:  :kbd:`Shift-Tab`

Enters Tweak Mode for the selected strip's action, making its keyframes available for editing in
e.g. the :doc:`Graph Editor </editors/graph_editor/introduction>`. In addition, marks the strip's
track as *Solo*, muting all the other tracks -- this way, they no longer influence the animation
and you can focus exclusively on the action you're editing.

While the menu item refers to stashed (muted) actions, this only reflects the typical use case.
It works on unmuted actions as well.

When you're done editing, click :menuselection:`Strip --> Stop Editing Stashed Action`
or press :kbd:`Shift-Tab` again.

.. list-table::

   * - .. figure:: /images/editors_nla_editing_nla-mode.png
          :width: 320px

          Strip in NLA mode.

     - .. figure:: /images/editors_nla_editing_edit-mode.png
          :width: 320px

          Strip in Tweak mode.


Start Tweaking Strips Actions (Full Stack)
==========================================

.. reference::

   :Editor:    Nonlinear Animation
   :Menu:      :menuselection:`Strip --> Start Tweaking Strips Actions (Full Stack)`
   :Shortcut:  :kbd:`Tab`

Enters Tweak Mode for the selected strip's action, making its keyframes available for editing.
Leaves all the other tracks enabled so that you can still see their effects while making changes.

When you're done, click :menuselection:`Strip --> Stop Tweaking Strips Actions`
or press :kbd:`Tab` again.

.. note::

   For transitions above the tweaked strip, keyframe remapping will fail
   for channel values that are affected by the transition.
   A workaround is to tweak the active strip without evaluating the upper NLA stack.


Start Tweaking Strips Actions (Lower Stack)
===========================================

.. reference::

   :Editor:    Nonlinear Animation
   :Menu:      :menuselection:`Strip --> Start Tweaking Strips Actions (Lower Stack)`

Enters Tweak Mode for the selected strip's action, making its keyframes available for editing.
Mutes any tracks above the current one so that they don't influence the animation while making changes.

When you're done, click :menuselection:`Strip --> Stop Tweaking Strips Actions` or press :kbd:`Tab`.

When using the keyboard shortcuts, make sure the mouse cursor is hovering over the track region,
as otherwise, Blender will only delete the selected strips.

Move
====

.. reference::

   :Editor:    Nonlinear Animation
   :Menu:      :menuselection:`Track --> Move`

   Moves the selected tracks to the top.
Up :kbd:`PageUp`
   Moves the selected tracks up by one.
Down :kbd:`PageDown`
   Moves the selected tracks down by one.
To Bottom :kbd:`Shift-PageDown`
   Moves the selected tracks to the bottom.

When using the keyboard shortcuts, make sure the mouse cursor is hovering over the track region,
as otherwise, Blender will move the selected strips to different tracks (rather than moving the tracks).

.. _bpy.ops.anim.channels_clean_empty:

Remove Empty Animation Data
===========================

.. reference::

   :Editor:    Nonlinear Animation
   :Menu:      :menuselection:`Track --> Remove Empty Animation Data`

Removes objects that don't have drivers, NLA tracks, or an active action
from the NLA editor to reduce clutter.
This essentially does the opposite of :menuselection:`Add --> Selected Objects`.

Header
======

.. _bpy.types.SpaceOutliner.display_mode:

Display Mode
------------

The editors header has a select menu that let you filter what the Outliner should show.
It helps to narrow the list of objects so that you can find things quickly and easily.

:Scenes:
   Shows *everything* the *Outliner* can display (in all scenes, all view layers, etc.).
:View Layer:
   Shows all the collections and objects in the current view layer.
:Video Sequencer:
   Lists data, images and videos, that are used by the :doc:`Video Sequencer </video_editing/index>`.
:Blender File:
   Lists all data in the current blend-file.
:Data API:
   Lists every :doc:`data-block </files/data_blocks>` along with any properties that they might have.
:Library Overrides:
   Display library override data in the current blend-file. Separated further into two view modes:

   .. _bpy.types.SpaceOutliner.lib_override_view_mode:

   Library Overrides Display Mode
      :Properties:
         Display data-blocks with overridden properties. The overridden properties are listed together with widgets to
         modify the value of the properties.
      :Hierarchies:
         Visualize the hierarchical dependencies between data-blocks with library overrides. For example, to create a
         library override of a mesh used by an object inside of a linked collection, Blender automatically creates
         (disabled) library overrides for the object and the collection, resulting in a collection > object > mesh
         library override hierarchy.

      .. _bpy.ops.ed.lib_id_override_editable_toggle:

   This library override view mode has a column on the right side
   of the editor to toggle if the library is editable or not.
:Unused Data:
   Lists :doc:`data-blocks </files/data_blocks>` and other data
   that are unused and/or will be lost when the file is reloaded.
   It includes data-blocks which have only a fake user. You can add/remove the Fake User
   by clicking on cross/tick icon on the right side of the Outliner editor.


.. _bpy.types.SpaceOutliner.filter_text:

Display Filter
--------------

You can search the view for data-blocks,
by using Search field in the header of the *Outliner*,
You can start a search using :kbd:`Ctrl-F` or clear a search with :kbd:`Alt-F`.

Main Region
===========

Object Mode
-----------

The far left of the Outliner contains a region to toggle the current :doc:`Object Mode </editors/3dview/modes>`.
When an object is in a mode other than Object Mode, the mode icon will be displayed in this region.
Any other objects that are valid to be added or swapped into the current mode display a dot.
Clicking the dot icon will swap that object with the current active object.
For modes that support :ref:`3dview-multi-object-mode`,
:kbd:`Ctrl-LMB` on the dot icon will add that object to the current mode.
Clicking the mode icon next to the active object removes it or all other objects
from the current mode depending if multiple object are in the same mode.


.. _editors-outliner-interface-restriction_columns:

Restriction Columns
-------------------

The following toggles, in the right side of the *Outliner* editor,
are available for collections, objects, bones, modifiers and constraints.

By default only the temporary viewport visibility is enabled.
The other options can be enabled in the *Restriction Toggles* option in the Outliner `filter`_.

- Holding :kbd:`Shift` sets or unsets the value to all its child collections or objects.
- Holding :kbd:`Ctrl` isolates the object or collection, so they are the only ones with its value set.

.. _bpy.types.LayerCollection.exclude:

Enable Collection (checkbox, collection only)
   Exclude the collection from the view layer.

Visibility (eye icon)
   Toggles the visibility of the object or collection in the 3D Viewport.
   This is a file-local setting, and does not get imported when this data-block
   is linked into another blend-file. Objects hidden this way are still part of
   the :doc:`View Layer </scene_layout/view_layers/index>` and evaluated,
   so they still affect playback performance.

.. note::

   The following options are hidden by default and need to be enabled in
   the Outliner Filter before they can be used.

.. _bpy.types.Collection.hide_select:

Selectability (mouse cursor icon)
   Toggles the ability to select the objects from the 3D Viewport.
   This is useful for if you have placed something in the scene
   and do not want to accidentally select it when working on something else.

.. _bpy.types.LayerCollection.hide_viewport:

Global Viewport Visibility (screen icon)
   This will still render the object/collection, but it will be ignored by all the viewports.
   Often used for collections with high-poly objects that need to be instanced in other files.
   Objects hidden this way are no longer part of the :doc:`View Layer </scene_layout/view_layers/index>`,
   are not evaluated, and such do not negatively affect playback performance.

Rendering (camera icon)
   This will still keep the object visible in the scene, but it will be ignored by the renderer.
   Usually used by support objects that help modeling and animation yet do not belong in the final images.

.. _bpy.types.LayerCollection.holdout:

Holdout (collection only)
   Mask out objects in collection from view layer.

.. _bpy.types.LayerCollection.indirect_only:

Indirect Only (collection only)
   Objects in these collections only contribute to indirect light -- *Cycles only*.


## Introduction

.. index:: Editors; Outliner

************
Introduction
************

.. figure:: /images/editors_outliner_introduction_interface.png
   :align: right

   The Outliner editor.

The *Outliner* is a list that organizes data in the blend-file,
i.e. the scene data, Video Sequencer data, or anything that gets stored in a blend-file.
The *Outliner* can be used to:

- View the data in the scene.
- Select and deselect objects in the scene.
- Hide or show an object in the scene.
- Enable or disable selection (to make an object "unselectable" in the 3D Viewport).
- Enable or disable the rendering of an object.
- Delete objects from the scene.
- Unlink data (equivalent to pressing the *X* button next to the name of a data-block).
- Manage collections in the scene.

.. (TODO) create new objects by drag & drop from the outliner

Each row in the *Outliner* shows a data-block. You can :kbd:`LMB` click the disclosure triangle to
the left of a name to expand the current data-block and see what other data-blocks it contains.
Holding :kbd:`Shift` when clicking on the disclosure triangle will expand child data-blocks recursively.
:kbd:`LMB` Clicking and dragging along disclosure triangles will expand or collapse multiple data-blocks.


Example
=======

.. figure:: /images/editors_outliner_introduction_example.png

   The Outliner with different kinds of data.


## Selecting


************************
Selecting and Activating
************************

.. figure:: /images/editors_outliner_selecting_example.png
   :align: right

   Selected data-blocks with the Cube active.

Selection is done with :kbd:`LMB` (and/or the :ref:`context menu <editors-outliner-editing-context_menu>`)
on the row of a data-block. Single selections will also activate the data-block.
The rows of selected data-blocks are highlighted blue, with the active data-block highlighted in a lighter blue.

Clicking in empty space below the list of data-blocks will deselect all.

.. note::

   By default, selecting data-blocks in the Outliner will select the respective objects,
   bones, and sequences in the 3D Viewport and Video Sequencer. Selections in the 3D Viewport
   and Video Sequencer will be synced to each Outliner. To disable selection syncing, turn off
   the toggle in the :ref:`filter <editors-outliner-interface-filter>` popover.

Children of a data-block can also be selected by clicking the icon that is displayed to
the right of the parent data-block's name.


Selecting Multiple Data-Blocks
==============================

Extend the selection one data-block at a time using :kbd:`Ctrl-LMB`.
Each data-block added to the selection this way will be made the active data-block.

Select a range of elements from the active element using :kbd:`Shift-LMB`.
To select a range without deselecting the previous selection, use :kbd:`Shift-Ctrl-LMB`.

Select all children of an item by double clicking the item's icon.

A click and drag from any location in the Outliner other than a name or icon will begin a box selection.
Use :kbd:`Shift` to add and :kbd:`Ctrl` to subtract from existing selections with box select.
Box select can also be started with :kbd:`B`.

To select all items use :kbd:`A`; :kbd:`Alt-A` will deselect all items.

The keyboard arrow keys can be used to navigate and select in the Outliner.
Keyboard selection and navigation starts from the active data-block.

.. list-table::
   :widths: 10 90

   * - :kbd:`Up`
     - Select the previous element in the list.
   * - :kbd:`Down`
     - Select the next element in the list.
   * - :kbd:`Shift-Up`
     - Select the previous element without deselecting.
   * - :kbd:`Shift-Down`
     - Select the next element without deselecting.
   * - :kbd:`Left`
     - Close the data-block or select the parent.
   * - :kbd:`Right`
     - Open the data-block to view children or select the first child.
   * - :kbd:`Shift-Left`
     - Close this and all child data-blocks.
   * - :kbd:`Shift-Right`
     - Open this and all child data-blocks.


.. _editors-outliner-properties-sync:

Properties Editor Sync
======================

When clicking the data-block icons or any other data icon (modifiers, constraints, object data, etc.),
:doc:`/editors/properties_editor` will change to the corresponding tab to modify the properties of
that data-block.This feature can be enabled or disabled in Properties editor using
the :ref:`Sync with Outliner <bpy.types.SpaceProperties.outliner_sync>` option.


## Usage


*****
Usage
*****

Relations Management
====================

.. figure:: /images/editors_outliner_usage_relations.png
   :align: right

   Linking objects to a collection.

Data-blocks can be dragged and dropped to manage data relations in the Outliner.
To begin a drag and drop, :kbd:`LMB` click and drag from the name or icon of a data-block.

Objects can be moved to collections by dropping on the name or contents of a collection.
To link an object to a collection, hold :kbd:`Ctrl` while dropping.
To set parent-child relations between objects, drop an object onto another object
while holding :kbd:`Shift`.

.. note::

   Drag and drop will attempt to operate on the entire selection. Selected data-blocks
   that are incompatible with the operation will remain unmodified.


Modifiers, Constraints, & Visual Effects
========================================

You can manage :doc:`Modifiers </modeling/modifiers/index>`, :doc:`Constraints </animation/constraints/index>`, and
:doc:`Visual Effects </grease_pencil/visual_effects/index>` from the Outliner in a couple ways:

- To change the order within the :ref:`stack <modifier-stack>`
  select the desired modifier and move it above or below other modifiers.
- To apply a single modifier, right click on the modifier and select apply in the popover menu.
- To delete a single modifier, right click on the modifier and select delete in the popover menu.
- To copy a single modifier to another, select the modifier and drag it on top of the desired object.
- To copy the whole modifier stack to another object, select the modifier icon and drag in to the desired object.

Drag & Dropping to 3D Viewport
==============================

Objects & Object Data
---------------------

Dragging object data-blocks from the Outliner to the :doc:`3D Viewport </editors/3dview/index>`
creates a :doc:`duplicate </scene_layout/object/editing/duplicate>` of the object.
Dragging *object data* data-blocks from the Outliner to the 3D Viewport
creates a :doc:`linked duplicate </scene_layout/object/editing/duplicate_linked>` of the object.


## Animation


*********
Animation
*********

The *Animation* section lets you manage settings related to :doc:`Animation </animation/index>`.

These preferences control how several tools will interact with your input.

.. figure:: /images/editors_preferences_section_editing.png


Objects
=======

New Objects
-----------

.. _bpy.types.PreferencesEdit.material_link:

Link Materials To
   To understand this option properly, you need to understand how Blender works with Objects.
   Almost everything in Blender is organized in a hierarchy of data-blocks.
   A data-block can be thought of as containers for certain pieces of information. For example,
   the Object data-block contains information about the Object's location, rotation, and scale
   while the associated linked Object Data data-block contains information about the mesh.

   .. figure:: /images/editors_preferences_editing_data-blocks-hierarchy.png

      Example for a mesh.

   A material may be linked in two different ways:

   :Object Data:
      Any created material will be created as part of the Object Data data-block.
   :Object:
      Any created material will be created as part of the Object data-block.

   .. figure:: /images/editors_preferences_editing_data-blocks-link.png

      A material linked to Object Data (left) and Object (right).

   .. seealso::

      :doc:`Read more about Blender's Data System </files/index>`.

.. _bpy.types.PreferencesEdit.object_align:

Align to
   :World:
      New objects align with world coordinates.
   :View:
      New object align with view coordinates.
   :3D Cursor:
      New objects align to the 3D cursor's orientation.

.. _bpy.types.PreferencesEdit.use_enter_edit_mode:

Enter Edit Mode
   If selected, Edit Mode is automatically activated when you create a new object.

.. _bpy.types.PreferencesEdit.collection_instance_empty_size:

Instance Empty Size
   The display size for empties when
   a new :doc:`collection instance </scene_layout/object/properties/instancing/collection>` is created.


.. _bpy.types.PreferencesEdit.use_duplicate:

Copy on Duplicate
-----------------

The checkboxes define what data is copied with a duplicated object and
what data remains linked. Any boxes that are checked will have their data copied along with
the duplication of the object. Any boxes that are not checked will instead have their data linked
from the source object that was duplicated.

For example, if you have *Mesh* checked,
then a full copy of the mesh data is created with the new object,
and each mesh will behave independently of the duplicate.
If you leave the mesh box unchecked then when you change the mesh of one object,
the change will be mirrored in the duplicate object.

The same rules apply to each of the checkboxes in the data-block list.


3D Cursor
=========

.. _bpy.types.PreferencesEdit.use_mouse_depth_cursor:

Cursor -- Surface Project
   When placing the cursor by clicking,
   the cursor is projected onto the surface under the cursor.

.. _bpy.types.PreferencesEdit.use_cursor_lock_adjust:

Cursor -- Lock Adjust
   When the viewport is locked to the cursor,
   moving the cursor avoids the view *jumping* based on the new offset.


Annotations
===========

.. _bpy.types.PreferencesEdit.grease_pencil_default_color:

Default Color
   The default color for new Annotate layers.

.. _bpy.types.PreferencesEdit.grease_pencil_eraser_radius:

Eraser Radius
   The size of the eraser used with the Annotate Tool.

.. seealso::

   :doc:`Read more about Annotations </interface/annotate_tool>`.


.. _bpy.types.PreferencesView.use_weight_color_range:

Weight Paint
============

*Mesh skin weighting* is used to control how much a bone deforms the mesh of a character.
To visualize and paint these weights, Blender uses a color ramp (from blue to green, and from yellow to red).
Enabling the checkbox will enable an alternate map using a ramp starting with an empty range.
Now you can create your custom map using the common color ramp options.
For detailed information see the :doc:`Color ramps </interface/controls/templates/color_ramp>` page.


Grease Pencil
=============

.. _bpy.types.PreferencesEdit.grease_pencil_manhattan_distance:

Manhattan
   The minimum number of pixels the mouse should have moved either
   horizontally or vertically before the movement is recorded.
   Decreasing this should work better for curvy lines.

.. _bpy.types.PreferencesEdit.grease_pencil_euclidean_distance:

Euclidean
   The minimum distance that mouse has to travel before movement is recorded.

.. seealso::

   :doc:`Read more about Grease Pencil </grease_pencil/index>`.


Text Editor
===========

.. _bpy.types.PreferencesEdit.use_text_edit_auto_close:

Auto Close Character Pairs
   Automatically insert the corresponding character to close an expression
   when typing characters such as quotes, brackets, braces, or parentheses.


.. _preferences-editing-node-editor:

Node Editor
===========

.. _bpy.types.PreferencesEdit.node_use_insert_offset:

Auto-Offset
   Automatically offset the following or previous nodes in a chain when inserting a new node.
   See :ref:`editors-nodes-usage-auto-offset` for more information.

   .. _bpy.types.PreferencesEdit.node_margin:

   Auto-offset Margin
      Margin to use for :ref:`offsetting nodes <editors-nodes-usage-auto-offset>`.


Miscellaneous
=============

.. _bpy.types.PreferencesEdit.sculpt_paint_overlay_color:

Sculpt Overlay Color
   Defines a color to be used in the inner part of
   the brushes circle when in Sculpt Mode, and it is placed as an overlay to the brush,
   representing the focal point of the brush influence.
   The overlay color is visible only when the overlay visibility is selected
   (clicking at the *eye* to set its visibility), and the transparency of the overlay is
   controlled by the alpha slider located at the :menuselection:`Tool tab --> Display panel` in the Sidebar.


## Experimental

.. _bpy.types.PreferencesExperimental:

************
Experimental
************

These preferences are reserved for features that are currently being worked on and are not yet complete.
This category can be enabled by enabling :ref:`Developer Extras <bpy.types.PreferencesView.show_developer_ui>`.
Most experimental features are only available in `Daily Builds <https://builder.blender.org/download/daily/>`__.

.. figure:: /images/editors_preferences_section_experimental.png

   Blender Preferences Experimental section.


Debugging
=========

.. _bpy.types.PreferencesExperimental.use_undo_legacy:

   Use legacy undo (slower than the new default one, but may be more stable in some cases).

.. _bpy.types.PreferencesExperimental.override_auto_resync:

Override Auto Resync
   Enables library overrides automatic resync detection and process on file load.
   Disable when dealing with older blend-files that need manual Resync (Enforce) handling.

.. _bpy.types.PreferencesExperimental.use_cycles_debug:

Cycles Debug
   Show the Cycles rendering debug panel.

.. _bpy.types.PreferencesExperimental.show_asset_debug_info:

Asset Debug Info
   Enable some extra fields in the Asset Browser to aid debugging.

.. _bpy.types.PreferencesExperimental.use_asset_indexing:

Asset Indexing
   Disabling the asset indexer forces every asset library refresh to completely reread assets from disk.

.. _bpy.types.PreferencesExperimental.use_viewport_debug:

Viewport Debug
   Enable viewport debugging options for developers in the overlays pop-over.

.. _bpy.types.PreferencesExperimental.use_eevee_debug:

## Extensions

.. _bpy.types.Addon:
.. _bpy.ops.wm.addon:
.. _bpy.types.WindowManager.addon:
.. _bpy.ops.preferences.addon:

**********
Extensions
**********

The *Extensions* section lets you manage the extensions preferences.

.. figure:: /images/editors_preferences_section_extensions.png

   Blender Preferences Extensions section.

.. seealso::

   To learn about extensions and how to create them, refer to the :ref:`Extensions <extensions-index>` page.

Install
=======

There are different ways to install an extension:

- **Install from the Website**: Drag the installation URL into Blender.
- **Install from Blender**: Search for the extension name and click on Install.
- **Install from Disk**: Use the dropdown menu in the top right,
  or drag-and-drop an extension ``.zip`` package into Blender.

Any installed extension can be removed. This is a permanent change, though.
To stop an extension temporarily, it is better to Disable it instead.


Install Legacy Add-on
---------------------

To install legacy addons, click the *Install from Disk* menu item and select the addon's
``.py`` file (if it has only one such file) or its ``.zip`` file.

The add-on will not be automatically enabled after installation; click the checkbox to do that.

Refresh
   Scans the :doc:`Add-on Directory </advanced/blender_directory_layout>` for new add-ons.

.. tip::

   While this screen doesn't allow installing a folder-based addon with loose ``.py`` files,
   you can still do so by adding it as a :ref:`Script Directory <bpy.types.ScriptDirectory>`:

   #. Create an empty directory in a location of your choice (e.g. ``my_scripts``).
   #. Add a subdirectory under ``my_scripts`` called ``addons``
      (it *must* have this name for Blender to recognize it).
   #. Place your addon folder inside this ``addons`` folder.
   #. Open the *File Paths* section of the *Preferences*.
   #. Add a *Script Directories* entry pointing to your script folder (e.g. ``my_scripts``).
   #. Save the preferences and restart Blender for it to recognize the new add-on location.

   The addons in this folder will automatically become available; all you need to
   do is enable them.


Update
======

You need to manually check for available updates.
Once an update is found, Blender will let you update any of the available extensions.

The current available version of an extension on the repository will always be considered the latest version.

Enable/Disable
==============

Once an extension is installed it can be disabled (or re-enabled) as part of the user preferences.
Some extension types do not support this, and will always be shown as enabled.

.. tip::

   If the Add-on does not activate when enabled,
   check the :doc:`Console window </advanced/command_line/index>`
   for any errors that may have occurred.


Settings
========

- **Check for Updates**: Manually check the online repositories for available updates.
- **Update All**: Update all the extensions that have an update available.
- **Install from Disk**: Install an extension from a ``.zip`` package.
  This is installed to a Local Repository and no updates will be available.
- **Install Legacy Add-on**: Add-ons are effectively replaced by extensions.
  However to keep old add-ons working for now, they can still be installed independently of the new system.


.. _bpy.types.AddonPreferences:

Add-on Preferences
------------------

Some add-ons may have their own preferences which can be found
in the *Preferences* section of the add-on information box.

Some add-ons use this section for example to enable/disable
certain functions of the add-on. Sometimes these might even all default to off.
So it is important to check if the enabled add-on has any particular preferences.


Filter
======

The available filtering options are:

- Enabled Extensions
- Installed Extensions
- Legacy Add-ons

Filter by Type
==============

- **All**: Show all the extension types combined.

Or show only extensions of a single type:

- **Add-ons**
- **Themes**

Repositories
============

By default Blender has a Local Repository and a Remote Repository pointing towards the
`Official Blender Extensions Platform <https://extensions.blender.org>`__.

In the cases where more repositories are needed (e.g., to access third party extension platforms),
new repositories can be added.

.. figure:: /images/editor_preferences_section_extensions_repositories.png

   Repositories.

To add new repositories click on the :menuselection:`+` icon:

- **Add Remote Repository**: Add a repository from a URL.
- **Add Local Repository**: Add a repository which will be managed by the user (to be used with Install from Disk).

To remove repositories click on the :menuselection:`-` icon:

- **Remove Repository**: Remove an extension repository.
- **Remove Repository & Files**: Remove a repository and delete all associated files when removing.

These changes are permanent and cannot be reversed.


## File Paths

.. _bpy.types.PreferencesFilePaths:
.. _prefs-file-paths:

**********
File Paths
**********

The *File* section in *Preferences* allows you to configure auto-save preferences
and set default file paths for blend-files, rendered images, and more.

Locations for various external files can be set for the following options:

.. figure:: /images/editors_preferences_section_file-paths.png

   Preferences File Paths section.

.. hint::

   The default path ``//`` refers to the folder of the currently open blend-file
   (see :ref:`files-blend-relative_paths` for details).


Data
====

.. _bpy.types.PreferencesFilePaths.font_directory:

Fonts
   Default location to browse for :doc:`text object </modeling/texts/index>` font files.

.. _bpy.types.PreferencesFilePaths.texture_directory:

Textures
   Default location to browse for image textures.

.. _bpy.types.PreferencesFilePaths.sound_directory:

Sounds
   Default location to browse for sound files.

.. _bpy.types.PreferencesFilePaths.temporary_directory:

Temporary Files
   The directory for storing temporary save files. The path must reference an existing directory
   or it will be ignored and the systems temporary directory will be used instead.
   When left blank, the systems temporary directory will be used (see :ref:`temp-dir` for details).


Render
------

.. _bpy.types.PreferencesFilePaths.render_output_directory:

Render Output
   Where rendered images/videos are saved.

.. _bpy.types.PreferencesFilePaths.render_cache_directory:

Render Cache
   The location where cached render images are stored.


.. _bpy.types.UserAssetLibrary:

Asset Libraries
===============

Name and on-drive directory paths of asset libraries.
To make Blender aware of an asset library, add it to this list.
The name is for your reference only, and will appear in asset library selectors.
The path should point to the location of the asset library.

.. figure:: /images/asset_browser-asset_library_preferences.png

   Name and Location of asset libraries in the Preferences.

To create a new asset library, just create an empty directory and add it to the :ref:`ui-list-view`.
Any asset from any blend-file contained in that directory
(or subdirectories thereof) will appear in the :doc:`/editors/asset_browser`.

.. _bpy.types.UserAssetLibrary.import_method:

Import Method
   Determines how data is managed when an asset is imported,
   unless overridden by the :ref:`Asset Browser <bpy.types.FileAssetSelectParams.import_method>`.

   :Link:
      *Same as* :menuselection:`File --> Link...`

      The asset will be linked to the current blend-file, and thus be read-only.
      Later changes to the asset file will be reflected in all files that link it in.
   :Append:
      *Same as* :menuselection:`File --> Append...`

      All of the asset and all its dependencies will be appended to the current file.
      Dragging a material into the scene three times will result in three independent copies.
      Dragging an object into the scene three times will also result in three independent copies.

      "Dependencies" in this case means everything the asset refers to.
      For an object, this can be its mesh and materials, but also other objects
      used by modifiers, constraints, or drivers.

      Since the file now has its own copy of the asset, later changes to
      the asset file will not be reflected in the file it's appended to.
   :Append (Reuse Data):
      *Specific to the Asset Browser*.

      The first time an asset is used, it will be appended, including its dependencies,
      just like described previously. However, Blender will keep track of where it originated,
      and the next time the asset is used, as much data as possible will be reused.
      Dragging a material into the scene three times will only load it once,
      and just assign the same material three times.
      Dragging an object into the scene three times will create three copies of the object,
      but all copies will share their mesh data, materials, etc.

      Since the file now has its own copy of the asset, later changes to
      the asset file will not be reflected in the file it's appended to.

.. _bpy.types.UserAssetLibrary.use_relative_path:

Relative Path
   Use relative path when linking assets from this asset library.


.. _bpy.ops.preferences.script_directory_add:
.. _bpy.ops.preferences.script_directory_remove:
.. _bpy.types.ScriptDirectory:

Script Directories
==================

Additional locations to search for Python scripts.

Each path can be given a *Name* to signify to purpose of that script directory.

By default, Blender looks in several directories (platform dependent) for scripts.
By adding a user script path in the preferences an additional directory is used.
This can be used to store your own scripts and add-ons independently of the current Blender version.

You will need to create specific subfolders in this path which match the structure of the ``scripts``
folder found in Blender's installation directory.

The following subdirectories will be used when present:

``startup/``
   Modules in this folder will be imported on startup.
``addons/``
   Add-ons located here will be listed in the add-ons preferences.
``modules/``
   Modules in this folder can be imported by other scripts.
``presets/``
   Presets in this folder will be added to existing presets.

.. note::

   You have to restart Blender for all changes to the users scripts to take effect.


Applications
============

.. _bpy.types.PreferencesFilePaths.image_editor:

Image Editor
   The path to an external program to use for image editing.

.. _bpy.types.PreferencesFilePaths.animation_player_preset:

Animation Player
   The program used for playing back rendered animations via
   :ref:`View Animation <topbar-render-view_animation>`.

   By default this is set to *Internal* which uses Blender's built-in
   :ref:`animation player <bpy.ops.render.play_rendered_anim>`.

   This has the advantage that all image formats supported by Blender can be played back
   and no 3rd party application needs to be installed.


.. _prefs-file_paths-text_editor:

Text Editor
-----------

.. _bpy.types.PreferencesFilePaths.text_editor:

Program
   Command to launch the text editor when using :ref:`Edit Externally <bpy.ops.text.jump_to_file_at_point>`,
   either a full path or a command in ``$PATH``. Use the internal editor when left blank.

.. _bpy.types.PreferencesFilePaths.text_editor_args:

Arguments
   Defines the specific format of the arguments with which the text editor opens files.

   The supported expansions are as follows:

   - ``$filepath``: The absolute path of the file.
   - ``$line``: The line to open at (Optional).
   - ``$column``: The column to open from the beginning of the line (Optional).
   - ``$line0`` & ``$column0`` similar to the above but they start at zero.

   Example: ``-f $filepath -l $line -c $column``


Development
===========

Only visible when :ref:`Developer Extras <bpy.types.PreferencesView.show_developer_ui>` are enabled.

.. _bpy.types.PreferencesFilePaths.i18n_branches_directory:

I18n Branches
   The path to the ``/branches`` directory of your local SVN translation copy, to allow translating from the UI.


Known Limitations
=================

Permissions on Windows
----------------------

Be sure that you have the right privileges for running the executable accessing the path defined.
On Windows for instance, if the option "Run this program as an administrator" is enabled for the executable,
it will lead to a failure to open the editor due to a limitation within the OS User Account Control.
Running a program with elevated privileges is potentially dangerous!

## Input

.. _bpy.types.PreferencesInput:

*****
Input
*****

In the Input preferences, you can customize how Blender reacts to the mouse and keyboard
as well as define your own keymap.

.. figure:: /images/editors_preferences_section_input.png


Keyboard
========

.. _bpy.types.PreferencesInput.use_emulate_numpad:

Emulate Numpad
   The Numpad keys are used quite often in Blender and are not assigned to the same action as
   the regular number keys. If you have a keyboard without a Numpad (e.g. on a laptop),
   you can tell Blender to treat the standard number keys as Numpad keys by checking *Emulate Numpad*.

.. _bpy.types.PreferencesInput.use_numeric_input_advanced:

Default to Advanced Numeric Input
   For transform mode, default to :ref:`transform-numeric-input-advanced`,
   otherwise :ref:`transform-numeric-input-simple` is used.


Mouse
=====

.. _bpy.types.PreferencesInput.use_mouse_emulate_3_button:

Emulate 3 Button Mouse
   Blender can be configured to work with pointing devices which do not have an :kbd:`MMB`.
   The functionality of the three mouse buttons by holding :kbd:`Alt-LMB`.

   Mouse/Keyboard combinations referenced in this manual
   can be expressed with the combinations shown in the table. For example:

   :kbd:`MMB` drag becomes :kbd:`Alt-LMB` drag for example.

   .. warning::

      This option prevents certain features from being accessed,
      since :kbd:`Alt-LMB` is used for some operations.

      - Modifying multiple items values at once (objects, bones... etc).
      - Deselecting edge/face rings in Edit Mode.
      - Detaching node links.
      - Moving the Compositor background image.

      Some touchpads support three-finger tap for middle mouse button,
      which may be an alternative to using this option.

   .. _bpy.types.PreferencesInput.mouse_emulate_3_button_modifier:

   Modifier
      The modifier key to press to emulate the middle mouse keybindings.
      This option is unsupported on Microsoft Windows.

      :Alt:
         Use the :kbd:`Alt` key to emulate the middle mouse button.
      :OSKey:
         Use the :kbd:`OSKey` to emulate the middle mouse button.

         This has the advantage that it doesn't conflict with existing :kbd:`Alt-MMB` shortcuts,
         noted above.

.. _bpy.types.PreferencesInput.use_mouse_continuous:

Continuous Grab
   This feature is used to prevent the problem where an action such as moving objects or panning a view,
   is limited by your screen bounds.

   This is done by warping the mouse within the view.

   .. note::

      Cursor warping is only supported by *relative* input devices (mouse, trackball, trackpad).

      Graphics tablets, however, typically use *absolute* positioning,
      this feature is disabled when a tablet is being used.

      This is detected for each action,
      so the presence of a tablet will not disable *Continuous Grab* for mouse cursor input.

.. _bpy.types.PreferencesInput.use_drag_immediately:

Release Confirms
   Dragging :kbd:`LMB` on an object will move it.
   To confirm this (and other) transform, an :kbd:`LMB` is necessary by default.
   When this option is activated, the release of :kbd:`LMB` acts as confirmation of the transform.

.. _bpy.types.PreferencesInput.mouse_double_click_time:

Double Click Speed
   The time in milliseconds to trigger a double click.

.. _bpy.types.PreferencesInput.drag_threshold_mouse:

Mouse Drag Threshold
   The number of pixels that a User Interface element has to be moved before it is recognized by Blender,
   values below this will be detected as click events.

.. _bpy.types.PreferencesInput.drag_threshold_tablet:

Tablet Drag Threshold
   The drag threshold for tablet events.

.. _bpy.types.PreferencesInput.drag_threshold:

Drag Threshold
   The drag threshold for non mouse/tablet events (keyboard or :term:`NDOF` for example).

   This affects :ref:`Pie Menu on Drag <keymap-pref-py_menu_on_drag>` keymap preference.

.. _bpy.types.PreferencesInput.move_threshold:

Motion Threshold
   The number of pixels the cursor must be moved before the movement is registered.
   This is helpful for tablet pens that are a lot more difficult to keep still,
   then this could help to reduce stuttering of the cursor position.

   .. note::

      Unlike the click/drag distinction, this is used to detect small movements
      for example, picking selection cycles through elements near the cursor.
      Once the cursor moves past this threshold, selection stops cycling and picks the closest item.


Touchpad
========

.. note::

   This panel is available on Windows, macOS, and Linux with Wayland.

.. _bpy.types.PreferencesInput.use_multitouch_gestures:

Multi-touch Gestures
   Use multi-touch gestures for navigation with touchpad, instead of scroll wheel emulation.
   For more detail on supported gestures,
   see :doc:`Configuring Peripherals </getting_started/configuration/hardware>`.

Tablet
======

.. _bpy.types.PreferencesInput.tablet_api:

Tablet API (Windows only)
   Select the native Windows Ink or older Wintab system for pressure sensitivity.
   Blender automatically selects the API for your operating system and tablet,
   however in case of problems this can be set manually.
   You may need to restart Blender for changes to take affect.

.. _bpy.types.PreferencesInput.pressure_threshold_max:

Max Threshold
   Amount of pressure required to achieve full intensity.

.. _bpy.types.PreferencesInput.pressure_softness:

Softness
   Controls how the softness of the low pressure response onset using a gamma curve.


.. _editors_preferences_input_ndof:

NDOF
====

These preferences control how an :ref:`NDOF device <hardware-ndof>` interacts with the 3D Viewport.
These preferences can also be accessed using the :kbd:`NDOFMenu` button on the NDOF device
to open a pop-up menu to adjust the settings directly from the 3D Viewport.

.. _bpy.types.PreferencesInput.ndof_sensitivity:

Pan Sensitivity
   The overall sensitivity for panning in the 3D Viewport.

.. _bpy.types.PreferencesInput.ndof_orbit_sensitivity:

Orbit Sensitivity
   The overall sensitivity for orbiting in the 3D Viewport.

.. _bpy.types.PreferencesInput.ndof_deadzone:

Deadzone
   The threshold for the amount of movement needed from
   the device's rest position for Blender to interrupt that movement.

.. _bpy.types.PreferencesInput.ndof_view_navigate_method:

Navigation
   Navigation style for the viewport.

   :Free: Uses the full 6-degrees of freedom.
   :Orbit: Orbit about the view center.

.. _bpy.types.PreferencesInput.ndof_view_rotate_method:

Rotation
   Rotation style for the viewport.

   :Turntable: Rotates the view keeping the horizon horizontal.
   :Trackball: Is less restrictive, allowing any orientation.

.. _bpy.types.PreferencesInput.ndof_show_guide:

Show Navigation Guide
   Display the pivot point and axis during rotation.

.. _bpy.types.PreferencesInput.ndof_zoom_invert:

Invert Zoom
   Zoom using opposite direction.

   :Menu:      :menuselection:`Edit --> Preferences...`
   :Shortcut:  :kbd:`Ctrl-Comma`

This chapter explains how to change Blender's default configuration with the *Preferences* editor.

The Blender *Preferences* contains settings to control how Blender behaves.
At the left of the editor, the available options are grouped into sections.

.. figure:: /images/editors_preferences_section_interface.png

   Blender Preferences window.


.. _bpy.ops.preferences.copy_prev:
.. _prefs-menu:

Managing Preferences
====================

Default preferences are managed from the :menuselection:`☰` menu in the preferences window.

The following items are available in this menu:

Auto-Save Preferences
   By default changes to preferences are saved on exit,
   this allows changes to the keymap and Quick Favorites menu to be stored and used between
   :term:`Blender Sessions <Blender Session>`.

   .. _bpy.ops.wm.save_userpref:

   When disabled, a *Save Preferences* button is shown to manually perform the operation.

.. _bpy.ops.wm.read_userpref:

Revert to Saved Preferences
   Undoes any unsaved modifications, loading the previously saved state.

.. _bpy.ops.wm.read_factory_userpref:

Load Factory Preferences
   Completely undo all the modifications made to the preferences,
   resetting to the state used before making customizations.

   .. note::

      After running *Load Factory Preferences*, auto-save will be disabled for the current
      :term:`session`.

      This allows you to switch back to the factory settings for testing
      or following tutorials for example, without the risk of accidentally auto-saving
      over the preferences you have manually configured.

      If you wish to save these as your preferences, run *Save Preferences* manually.

   .. note::

      This only resets the preferences and will not affect settings stored in the startup file.
      This includes app templates, area locations, and any Blender properties not part of the preferences.

      These must be reverted though :menuselection:`File --> Defaults`.

.. tip::

   It can be valuable to make a backup of your preferences in the event that you lose your configuration.

   See the :doc:`directory layout </advanced/blender_directory_layout>`
   section to see where your preferences are stored.


## Keymap

.. _prefs-input-keymap-editor:

******
Keymap
******

The keymap editor lets you adjust your keymap via:

:Presets: Predefined keymaps which come with Blender and can be added to.
:Preferences: Keymaps may define their own preferences to change the functionality or add additional key bindings.
:Key Map Items: You may add/remove/edit individual keymap entries.

.. figure:: /images/editors_preferences_section_keymap.png

   Blender Preferences Keymap section.


.. _bpy.ops.preferences.keyconfig:

Preset Management
=================

Keymap Presets
   Select the keymap from a list of predefined keymaps.

   .. _bpy.ops.wm.keyconfig_preset_add:

   You add a custom keymap configuration to the preset list by :kbd:`LMB` on the *Add* button ``+``.

   .. _bpy.ops.wm.keyconfig_preset_remove:

   You remove a custom keymap configuration from the preset list by :kbd:`LMB` on the *Remove* button ``-``.

.. _bpy.ops.preferences.keyconfig_import:

Import
   Importing opens a File Browser to select a ``.py`` file to add to the list of keymap presets.

.. _bpy.ops.preferences.keyconfig_export:

Export
   Saves the current keymap configuration as a preset others may use.

   All Keymaps
      When disabled, only the keymaps and categories that have been modified by the user will be exported.
      In addition, add-ons may register keymaps to their respective functions,
      however, these keymaps are not exported unless changed by the user.
      This exported file may be thought of as a *"keymap delta"* instead of a full keymap export.

      When enabled, the entire keymap is written.


Filtering
---------

.. _bpy.types.SpacePreferences.filter_type:

Filter Type
   :Name:
      Search the keymap item by the operator name it runs.
   :Key Binding:
      Search the keymap item by the key used to activate it.

      .. hint::

         You could for example search with ``Ctrl Shift C`` for keymap items that use all these keys.

.. _bpy.types.SpacePreferences.filter_text:

Search
   The text to search (leave blank to disable).


Preferences
===========

Keymaps may define their own preferences, these are predefined adjustments to the keymap you can make
without having to manually adjust individual keymap items which can cause problems with newer `Blender Versions`_.

See the :ref:`default keymap preferences <keymap-blender_default-prefs>`
for options available in the default keymap.


.. _bpy.ops.preferences.keyitem:
.. _bpy.types.KeyMapItem:

Editor
======

The Keymap editor lets you change the default hotkeys. You can change keymaps for each of Blender's editors.

.. figure:: /images/editors_preferences_keymap_keymap-editor.png

   Keymap editor.


.. rubric:: Usage

#. Select the keymap you want to change and click on the white arrows to open up the keymap tree.
#. Select which Input will control the function.
#. Change hotkeys as you want. Just click on the shortcut input and enter the new shortcut.

.. _bpy.types.KeyMapItem.active:

Active
   Uncheck to disable this keymap item.

.. _bpy.types.KeyMapItem.map_type:

.. _bpy.types.KeyMapItem.idname:

Operator ID Name
   The identifier for the operator to call.

   .. hint::

      See :mod:`blender_api:bpy.ops` for a list of operators (remove the ``bpy.`` prefix for the identifier).

Event
   .. _bpy.types.KeyMapItem.type:

   Type
      The key or button that activates this keymap item (depending on the map type).

   .. _bpy.types.KeyMapItem.value:

   Value
      The action (such as press, release, click, drag, etc.), (depending on the map type).

   .. _bpy.types.KeyMapItem.key_modifier:

   Modifier
      Additional keys to hold (such as :kbd:`Ctrl`, :kbd:`Shift`, :kbd:`Alt`).

Operator Properties
   Changes to the defaults properties this operator is activated with

.. seealso::

   :ref:`keymap-customize` for more information on keymap editing.


Restoring
---------

If you want to restore the default settings for a keymap,
just click on the *Restore* button at the top right of this keymap.

.. tip::

   Instead of deleting the default keymap to create your custom one,
   you can just add a new *Preset* for both the mouse and keyboard.


Known Limitations
=================

Blender Versions
----------------

A problem with modifying your own keymap is newer Blender versions key change the way tools are accessed,
breaking your customized keymap.

While the keymap can be manually updated, the more customizations you make, the higher the chance of conflicts
in newer Blender versions is.


## Lights

.. _bpy.ops.preferences.studiolight:

******
Lights
******

.. figure:: /images/editors_preferences_section_lights.png

   Blender Preferences Lights section.


.. _prefs-lights-studio:

Studio Lights
=============

Studio Lights are used to illuminate the 3D Viewport during *Solid View* and will not be rendered.
Unlike lights in the scene, the lighting direction follows the viewport orientation.


.. _bpy.types.UserSolidLight:

Editor
------

.. _bpy.types.PreferencesSystem.use_studio_light_edit:
.. _bpy.ops.preferences.studiolight_new:

There are up to four virtual light sources.

The Light toggles allow you to enable or disable individual lights.
At least one of the four lights must remain enabled for the 3D Viewport.
The lights are equal, except for their direction and color.
You can control the direction of the lights, as well as their diffuse and specular colors.

.. _bpy.types.UserSolidLight.use:

Use Light
   Toggles the specific light.

.. _bpy.types.UserSolidLight.diffuse_color:

Diffuse
   This is the constant color of the light.

.. _bpy.types.UserSolidLight.specular_color:

Specular
   This is the highlight color of the light.

.. _bpy.types.UserSolidLight.smooth:

Smooth
   Smooth the shading from this light.

   *This has the effect of lighting to be less direct.*

.. _bpy.types.UserSolidLight.direction:

Direction
   The direction of the light, (see :ref:`ui-direction-button`).

   The direction of the light will be the same as shown at the sphere surface.

.. _bpy.types.PreferencesSystem.light_ambient:

Ambient Color
   The color of unlit areas.


.. _prefs-lights-matcaps:

MatCaps
=======


This panel manages :term:`MatCap` image files
which can used to light the view when :ref:`MatCap <render-workbench-matcap>` shading is enabled.

Two kinds of images are supported for MatCaps. Regular image files and
multilayered OpenEXR files. When using multilayered OpenEXR files,
the layer named "diffuse" will be used as a diffuse pass, the layer named "specular"
will be used as a specular pass. Regular images will be handled as "diffuse" and
will not support specular highlighting.

The diffuse pass is multiplied with the base color of the objects and the specular pass is added on top.
MatCaps, that only have a diffuse pass tend to look very metallic,
with a separate specular pass it is possible to simulate a wider variety of materials.


HDRIs
=====

This panel manages :term:`HDRI` image files
which can be used to light the view when :ref:`Material Preview <3dview-material-preview>` or
:ref:`Rendered <3dview-rendered>` shading is enabled.


## Navigation

**********
Navigation
**********

.. figure:: /images/editors_preferences_section_navigation.png

   Blender Preferences navigation section.


.. _prefs-input-orbit-style:

Orbit & Pan
===========


.. _bpy.types.PreferencesInput.view_rotate_method:

Orbit Method
   Choose you are preferred method of interactively rotating the 3D Viewport.

   :Turntable:
      Rotates the view keeping the horizon horizontal.

      This behaves like a potter's wheel or record player where you have two axes of rotation available,
      and the world seems to have a better definition of what is "Up" and "Down" in it.

      The drawback to using the *Turntable* style is that you lose some flexibility when working with your objects.
      However, you gain the sense of "Up" and "Down" which can help if you are feeling disoriented.
   :Trackball:
      Is less restrictive, allowing any orientation.

.. _bpy.types.PreferencesInput.view_rotate_sensitivity_turntable:

Orbit Sensitivity
   Adjusts the reactivity/speed of orbiting in the 3D Viewport.
   This setting works differently depending on what *Orbit Method* is used:

   - Turntable: *Orbit Sensitivity* controls the amount
     of rotation per-pixel to control how fast the 3D Viewport rotates.
   - Trackball: *Orbit Sensitivity* as a simple factor for how fast the 3D Viewport rotates.

.. _bpy.types.PreferencesInput.use_rotate_around_active:

Orbit Around Selection
   The selection center becomes the rotation center of the viewport.
   When there is no selection the last selection will be used.

   The method used to calculate the center depends on the the current mode:

   - Object mode uses the selections bounding box center.
   - Edit & pose mode use the selected elements center.
   - Paint modes use the center of the last brush stroke.

   .. note::

      While this may seem like ideal behavior,
      it can be inconvenient for larger objects such as a terrain mesh,
      where the center is not necessarily a point of interest.

.. _bpy.types.PreferencesInput.use_auto_perspective:

Auto -- Perspective
   When enabled, the view switches to Perspective when orbiting the view,
   and to Orthographic when aligning to an axis (Top, Side, Front, Back, etc.).

   When disabled, this switching needs to be done manually.

.. _bpy.types.PreferencesInput.use_mouse_depth_navigate:

Auto -- Depth
   Use the depth under the mouse to improve view pan, rotate, zoom functionality.
   Useful in combination with *Zoom To Mouse Position*.

.. _bpy.types.PreferencesView.smooth_view:

Smooth View
   Time (in milliseconds) the animation takes when changing views
   (Top/Side/Front/Camera...). Reduce to zero to remove the animation.

.. _bpy.types.PreferencesView.rotation_angle:

Rotation Angle
   Rotation step size in degrees, when :kbd:`Numpad4`, :kbd:`Numpad6`, :kbd:`Numpad8`,
   or :kbd:`Numpad2` are used to rotate the 3D Viewport.


Zoom
====

.. _bpy.types.PreferencesInput.view_zoom_method:

Zoom Method
   Choose your preferred style of zooming in and out,
   when using interactive zoom.

   :Scale:
      *Scale* zooming depends on where you first click in the view.
      To zoom out, move the cursor to the area center.
      To zoom in, move the cursor away from the area center.
   :Continue:
      The *Continue* zooming option allows you to control the speed
      (and not the value) of zooming by moving away from the initial cursor position.

      Moving up from the initial click point or to the right will zoom out,
      moving down or to the left will zoom in. The further away you move,
      the faster the zoom movement will be.
      The directions can be altered by the *Vertical* and *Horizontal* radio buttons and
      the *Invert Zoom Direction* option.
   :Dolly:
      *Dolly* zooming works similarly to *Continue* zooming except that zoom speed is constant.

.. _bpy.types.PreferencesInput.view_zoom_axis:

Zoom Axis
   The axis of the mouse to use for zooming.

   :Vertical: Moving up zooms out and moving down zooms in.
   :Horizontal: Moving left zooms in and moving right zooms out.

.. _bpy.types.PreferencesInput.use_zoom_to_mouse:

Zoom to Mouse Position
   When enabled, the mouse pointer position becomes the focus point of zooming instead of the 2D window center.
   Helpful to avoid panning if you are frequently zooming in and out.

   .. tip::

      This is useful in combination with :ref:`Auto Depth <bpy.types.PreferencesInput.use_mouse_depth_navigate>`
      to quickly zoom into the point under the cursor.

.. _bpy.types.PreferencesInput.invert_mouse_zoom:

Invert Zoom Direction -- Mouse
   Inverts the Zoom direction for *Dolly* and *Continue* zooming.

.. _bpy.types.PreferencesInput.invert_zoom_wheel:

Invert Zoom Direction -- Wheel
   Inverts the direction of the mouse wheel zoom.

   Number of versions created (for backup) when saving newer versions of a file.

   This option keeps saved versions of your file in the same directory,
   using extensions: ``.blend1``, ``.blend2``, etc.,
   with the number increasing to the number of versions you specify.

   Older files will be named with a higher number.
   E.g. with the default setting of 2, you will have three versions of your file:

   - ``*.blend`` -- last saved.
   - ``*.blend1`` -- second last saved.
   - ``*.blend2`` -- third last saved.

.. _bpy.types.PreferencesFilePaths.recent_files:

:Metal:
   If the system has a compatible Apple Metal device, it will be available as an option for rendering with Cycles.

.. _prefs-system-cycles-distributive-memory:

Distribute Memory Across Devices
   Allocates resources across multiple GPUs rather than duplicating data,
   effectively freeing up space for larger scenes. Note that in order for this option to be available,
   the GPUs must be connected together with a high bandwidth communication protocol.

   Currently only NVLink on Nvidia GPUs is supported.

Embree on GPU
   Enables the use of hardware ray tracing on Intel GPUs, providing better overall performance.

   Only supported with oneAPI rendering devices..

HIP RT (Experimental)
   Speeds up rendering by enabling AMD hardware ray tracing on RDNA2 and above, with shader fallback on older cards.
   This feature is experimental and some scenes may render incorrectly.

   This feature is only available when using a *HIP* render device.

MetalRT
   MetalRT for ray tracing uses less memory for scenes which use curves extensively,
   and can give better performance in specific cases.

   :Off: Disable MetalRT (uses BVH2 layout for intersection queries).
   :On: Enable MetalRT for intersection queries.
   :Auto: Automatically pick the fastest intersection method.


Operating System Settings
=========================

Make this installation your default Blender (MS-Windows & Linux only).

On Linux, if Blender is installed from a package manager such as Snap,
file association is handled by the package manager.

Register
   Make the currently in use Blender installation the default
   for generating thumbnails and the default for opening blend-files.
Unregister
   Remove file association & thumbnailer.

For All Users
   Register Blender for all users, requires escalated privileges.


.. admonition:: Linux Registration
   :class: note

   Files are setup files under: ``/usr/local`` for all users, otherwise ``~/.local`` is used.

   - A desktop file & icon is installed so the application is available in launchers.
   - A file association for ``*.blend`` is setup.
   - The thumbnailer is installed so blend-file thumbnails will be shown in file managers (**For All Users** only).

Themes
******

The *Themes* section allows you to customize interface appearance and colors.

.. figure:: /images/editors_preferences_section_themes.png

The colors for each editor can be set separately by simply selecting the editor you wish to
change in the multi-choice list at the left, and adjusting colors as required.
Notice that changes appear in real-time on your screen. In addition, details such as the dot size
in the *3D Viewport* or the *Graph Editor* can also be changed.

Themes use Blender's preset system to save a theme.
This will save the theme to an XML file in the ``./scripts/presets/interface_theme/`` subdirectory of one of
the :doc:`configuration directories </advanced/blender_directory_layout>`.

.. figure:: /images/editors_preferences_themes_example.png

   Blender comes bundled with a small selection of themes.

   This is an example of the theme *Blender Light*.

   .. _bpy.types.PreferencesView.show_view_name:

   View Name
      Display the name and type of the current view in the top left corner of the 3D Viewport.
      For example: "User Perspective" or "Top Orthographic".

.. _bpy.types.PreferencesView.show_playback_fps:

Playback Frame Rate (FPS)
   Show the frames per second screen refresh rate while an animation is played back.
   It appears in the top left of the 3D Viewport, displaying red if the frame rate set cannot be reached.

   .. _bpy.types.PreferencesView.playback_fps_samples:

   Frame Rate Samples
      Calculate the FPS displayed in the viewport based on an average of the current and previously displayed frames.
      A value of zero uses the number of frames in 1.0 second.

      - More samples represent the average FPS over a longer period of time,
        however sudden changes to performance result in a more gradual increase/decrease over time.
      - Fewer samples shows an FPS which more closely matches the actual performance,
        however the value may jitter - making the FPS difficult to comprehend.

.. _bpy.types.PreferencesView.gizmo_size:

Gizmo Size
   Diameter of the gizmo.

.. _bpy.types.PreferencesView.lookdev_sphere_size:

   Limit the maximum resolution for pictures used in textured display to save memory.
   The limit options are specified in a square of pixels
   (e.g: the option 256 means a texture of 256×256 pixels). This is useful for game engineers,
   whereas the texture limit matches paging blocks of the textures in the target graphic card memory.

.. _bpy.types.PreferencesSystem.anisotropic_filter:

Anisotropic Filtering
   Sets the level of anisotropic filtering.
   This improves the quality of textures that are rendered at the cost of performance.

.. _bpy.types.PreferencesSystem.gl_clip_alpha:

Clip Alpha
   Clip alpha below this threshold in the 3D Viewport.
   Note that, the default is set to a low value to prevent issues on some GPUs.

.. _bpy.types.PreferencesSystem.image_draw_method:

Image Display Method
   Method to render images; the following options are supported:

   :Automatic:
      Automatically use *GLSL* which runs on the GPU for performance but falls back to
      the CPU for large images which might be slow when loaded with the GPU.
   :2D Texture:

## Introduction

.. index:: Editors; Texture Node Editor
.. index:: Nodes; Texture Nodes

************
Introduction
************

The Texture Node Editor allows creating custom textures by combining colors,
procedural patterns, and images in various ways. This is a step up from the
:doc:`built-in textures </render/materials/legacy_textures/introduction>`,
where you can select a type from a list and not much more.

.. note::

   Textures -- both built-in ones and node-based ones -- are a legacy feature.
   For their original main purpose, which was of course texturing objects,
   they have been replaced by :doc:`Materials </render/materials/introduction>`
   which are set up in the :doc:`/editors/shader_editor`.

   Today, the use of Textures is limited to:

   * :doc:`Brushes </sculpt_paint/brush/texture>`.
   * The :doc:`/modeling/modifiers/deform/displace`.
   * Influencing size, density etc. of :doc:`particle systems </physics/particles/texture_influence>`.
   * Influencing emission locations of :ref:`fire/smoke simulations <bpy.types.FluidFlowSettings.use_texture>`.
   * :doc:`Compositing </compositing/types/input/texture>`.

   In addition, the Displace modifier and fire/smoke simulations don't support
   node-based textures, instead only working with the built-in ones.

.. figure:: /images/editors_texture-node_introduction_types-combined.png
   :width: 600px

   Combined textures based on nodes.


Using Texture Nodes
===================

The default Blender layout has no workspace containing the Texture Node Editor.
You need to manually open it in an :doc:`area </interface/window_system/areas>` of choice.

Once the editor is open, you first need to set the empty *Texture Type* selector to *Brush*,
after which you can use the :doc:`/interface/controls/templates/data_block`
to start creating textures. Note that you need to enable *Use Nodes* in the header
before you can add nodes.


Header
======

See :doc:`Nodes </interface/controls/nodes/introduction>` for the header items common to
all node editors.

Texture Type
   World
      Deprecated -- the scene's :doc:`/render/lights/world` is now defined using
      a Material rather than a Texture.
   Brush
      Show brush Textures in the data-block menu. Because the other two types are deprecated,
      this effectively shows all Textures.
   Line Style
      Deprecated -- :doc:`Line Styles </render/freestyle/view_layer/line_style/introduction>`
      for the Freestyle renderer are now defined using Materials rather than Textures.

## Introduction

.. index:: Editors; UV Editor

************
Introduction
************

The UV Editor is used for editing UV maps, which describe how a 2D image should be mapped
onto a 3D object.

.. figure:: /images/editors_uv_introduction_main.png

   UV Editor with a UV map and a test grid texture.

Image textures are typically needed when the desired look is hard to achieve with procedural textures,
or if the texture is not uniform. For example, a car would only have scratches in a few places where they make sense,
not in random places all over its body.

Blender offers a number of projections (Box, Sphere...) that automatically apply a 2D image to a 3D object,
but these tend to only work for simple meshes. For more complex ones, you need to create a UV map instead.
This is a flat area where each face of the 3D object is laid out on the 2D image, specifying which part of the
image it should be textured with. This gives you complete control over the mapping process.

The name "UV" refers to the axes of the map: U for horizontal, V for vertical. These letters were chosen to
avoid confusion with "X" and "Y", which refer to axes in 3D space instead.


UVs Explained
=============

The best analogy to understand UV mapping is cutting up a cardboard box.
If you were to take a pair of scissors and cut along its edges,
you would be able to spread it out flat on a tabletop. As you are looking down at the table,
we could say that U is the left-right direction, and V is the up-down direction.

As a next step, you could put the spread-out box on top of a poster, cut the poster
to match its shape, glue the poster to the box, and finally reassemble the box.
You now have a 3D box textured with a 2D image.

A UV map describes how the box is cut up, and how it's laid out on the poster.
You have complete freedom in how to do this: if you wanted to, you could cut each individual
side of the box and position, rotate, scale, and even skew it on the poster
independently of the other sides.


Example
-------

.. figure:: /images/editors_uv_introduction_3d-uv-space.png
   :width: 620px

   3D space (XYZ) versus UV space.

In the above image, a dome in 3D space is flattened into a disc in UV space.
Each 3D face is then textured with the part of the image it covers in the UV map.

The image also demonstrates a common problem in UV maps: distortion. Notice how,
even though the checkered squares in the 2D texture are all the same size,
they get different sizes when applied to the 3D dome (they're smaller at the base
than at the top). This is because the faces in the UV map have different relative
sizes than in 3D space, which is a result of the flattening process.

You'll typically want to minimize this distortion by manually guiding and tweaking
the flattening, using :doc:`seams </modeling/meshes/uv/unwrapping/seams>` for example.
However, it's not always possible to eliminate it completely.


Interface
=========

Header
------

.. figure:: /images/editors_uv_introduction_texturing-header.png

   UV Editor header.

The header contains several menus and options for working with UVs.

Sync Selection
   Synchronizes the selection between the UV Editor and the 3D Viewport.
   See :ref:`Sync Selection <bpy.types.ToolSettings.use_uv_select_sync>` for more details.

Selection Mode
   The UV element type to select.
   See :ref:`Selection Mode <bpy.types.ToolSettings.uv_select_mode>` for more details.

Sticky Selection Mode
   Which other vertices to select automatically.
   See :ref:`Sticky Selection Mode <bpy.types.ToolSettings.uv_sticky_select_mode>` for more details.

View
   Tools for controlling how the content is displayed in the editor.
   See :doc:`/editors/uv/navigating`.

Select
   Tools for :doc:`selecting UVs </editors/uv/selecting>`.

Image
   Tools for opening and manipulating images.
   See :doc:`/editors/image/editing`.

UV
   Contains tools for :doc:`Unwrapping Meshes </modeling/meshes/uv/unwrapping/introduction>`
   and :doc:`Editing UVs </modeling/meshes/uv/editing>`.

Pivot :kbd:`Period`
   See :doc:`/editors/3dview/controls/pivot_point/index`.

Snap :kbd:`Shift-Tab`
   See :doc:`/editors/uv/controls/snapping`.

Proportional Editing :kbd:`O`
   See :doc:`Proportional Editing </editors/3dview/controls/proportional_editing>`.

Image
   A :ref:`data-block menu <ui-data-block>` used for selecting images.
   When an image has been loaded or created in the UV Editor,
   the :doc:`Image panel </editors/image/image_settings>` appears in the Sidebar region.

Image Pin
   When enabled the current image remains visible regardless of the object selection.
   This switching only happens if the 3D Viewport is in Edit Mode or Texture Paint Mode.

   This can be useful to enable when an image is used as a reference.

Show Gizmo
   Lets you show/hide all gizmos using the toggle button, or specific gizmos using
   the drop-down arrow.

   Navigate
      Enable/disable the gizmos used to pan or zoom the 2D viewport.
      See :ref:`Navigation Gizmos <editors-uv-navigate-gizmos>` for more information.

Show Overlays
   Lets you show/hide all overlays using the toggle button, or specific overlays
   using the drop-down arrow. See :doc:`/editors/uv/overlays`.

Active UV Loop Layer
   Select which UV map to use.

Display Channels
   Select what color channels are displayed.

   :Color & Alpha:
      Enables transparency and shows a checkerboard behind the image.
   :Color:
      Displays the colored image, without alpha channel.
   :Alpha:
      Displays the alpha channel as a grayscale image. White areas are opaque, black areas are transparent.
   :Z-Buffer:
      Displays the depth from the camera, from Clip Start to Clip End,
      as specified in the :doc:`Camera settings </render/cameras>`.
   :Red, Green, Blue:
      Single color channel visualized as a grayscale image.


## Navigating


**********
Navigating
**********

2D Viewport
===========

Panning can be done by dragging with :kbd:`MMB`.

Zooming can be done using :kbd:`Wheel` or :kbd:`NumpadPlus`/:kbd:`NumpadMinus`.


.. _editors-uv-navigate-gizmos:

Gizmos
======

Next to the Sidebar region at the top, there are gizmos that allow panning
and zooming more comfortably when e.g. no mouse wheel is available.


View Menu
=========

Also see :doc:`/editors/image/navigating` in the Image Editor.

Frame Selected :kbd:`NumpadPeriod`
   Change the view so that all selected UV vertices are visible.


2D Cursor
=========

Just like the :doc:`3D Viewport </editors/3dview/3d_cursor>`, the UV Editor has a Cursor
that you can jump to (:menuselection:`View --> Center View to Cursor`). It can also serve as
a :doc:`pivot point </editors/3dview/controls/pivot_point/index>` and a
:ref:`snapping target <bpy.ops.uv.snap_selected>`.

To change the Cursor's position, either press :kbd:`LMB` with the Cursor tool selected,
or :kbd:`Shift-RMB` with any tool selected. You can also change the "Location X/Y" fields
in the *View* tab of the Sidebar, in either relative coordinates (0 to 1) or
:ref:`pixel coordinates <bpy.types.SpaceUVEditor.show_pixel_coords>`.
In both cases, the lower left corner of the image serves as the origin (0, 0).

You can press :kbd:`Shift-C` to move the Cursor to the center.

If turned off (the default), the UV Editor only shows the faces that are selected in the
3D Viewport. Selecting an item in one editor does not automatically select it in the other.
If one 3D vertex/edge corresponds to multiple UV vertices/edges, you can select each
of those individually.

If turned on, the UV Editor always shows all faces. Selecting an item in one editor also
selects it in the other. If one 3D vertex/edge corresponds to multiple UV vertices/edges,
you can't select those individually (you can only select all of them).

Selection Mode
==============

:Vertex: :kbd:`1` Select vertices.
:Edge: :kbd:`2` Select edges.
:Face: :kbd:`3` Select faces.
:Island: :kbd:`4` Select contiguous groups of faces. Only available if *Sync Selection* is disabled.

If *Sync Selection* is enabled, you can hold :kbd:`Shift` while clicking a selection mode to
activate multiple ones at the same time, or :kbd:`Ctrl` to expand/contract the selection.

   :doc:`Mesh Selection </modeling/meshes/selecting/introduction>`


.. _bpy.types.ToolSettings.uv_sticky_select_mode:

Sticky Selection Mode
=====================

Options for automatically selecting additional UV vertices. Only available if *Sync Selection* is disabled.

Disabled
   Each UV vertex can be selected independently of the others.
Shared Location
   Automatically select UV vertices that correspond to the same mesh vertex and have the same UV coordinates.
   This is the default and gives the illusion that multiple faces in a UV map can share the same vertex;
   in reality, they have separate vertices that overlap.
Shared Vertex
   Automatically select UV vertices that correspond to the same mesh vertex,
   even if they have different UV coordinates.
   This is also the behavior when *Sync Selection* is enabled.

Select Menu
===========

All :kbd:`A`
   Selects all UV elements.
None :kbd:`Alt-A`
   Deselects all UV elements.
Invert :kbd:`Ctrl-I`
   Inverts the current selection.
Box Select :kbd:`B`
   See :ref:`Box Select <bpy.ops.*.select_box>`.
Box Select Pinned :kbd:`Ctrl-B`
   Like *Box Select*, but only selects :ref:`pinned <bpy.ops.uv.pin>` UV vertices.
Circle Select
   See :ref:`Circle Select <bpy.ops.*.select_circle>`.
More/Less :kbd:`Ctrl-NumpadPlus`, :kbd:`Ctrl-NumpadMinus`
   Expands/contracts the selection to/from the adjacent elements.
Select Pinned :kbd:`Shift-P`
   Selects all pinned UVs.
Select Linked
   Linked :kbd:`Ctrl-L`
      Selects all elements that are connected to the currently selected ones.
   Shortest Path
      Selects the path between two selected elements. (See below)

.. _bpy.ops.uv.select_similar:

Select Similar :kbd:`Shift-G`
   Selects UV elements that are similar to the :term:`active` one in some way.
   The :ref:`bpy.ops.screen.redo_last` panel provides several options:

   Type
      The property to compare. Which properties are available depends on the
      :ref:`Selection Mode <bpy.types.ToolSettings.uv_select_mode>`.

      Vertex Selection Mode
         :Pinned: Selects vertices with the same :ref:`pinned <bpy.ops.uv.pin>` state.

      Edge Selection Mode
         :Length: Selects edges with a similar length in the UV map.
         :Length 3D: Selects edges with a similar length in the 3D mesh.
         :Pinned: Selects edges with the same pinned state.

      Face Selection Mode
         :Area: Selects faces with a similar area in the UV map.
         :Area 3D: Selects faces with a similar area in the 3D mesh.
         :Material: Selects faces that have the same :doc:`Material </render/materials/index>`.
         :Object:
            Selects faces that belong to the same object.
            This is useful when multiple objects are in Edit mode at once.
         :Polygon Sides: Selects faces with a similar number of edges.
         :Winding: Select faces that have the same orientation (facing upwards or downwards in the UV map).

      Island Selection Mode
         :Area: Selects islands with a similar area in the UV map.
         :Area 3D: Selects islands with a similar area in the 3D mesh.
         :Amount of Faces in Island: Selects islands with a similar number of faces.

   Compare
      The comparison operator.

      :Equal: Select elements whose value is equal.
      :Greater: Select elements whose value is greater or equal.
      :Less: Select elements whose value is less or equal.
   Threshold
      Tolerance for values that are almost, but not quite the same. A higher threshold will select more elements.

Select Split :kbd:`Y`
   "Detaches" the selected faces so they can be moved elsewhere without affecting their neighbors.

   .. hint::

      Unlike :doc:`Split Selection </modeling/meshes/editing/mesh/split>` for meshes, which physically disconnects
      faces, this is a pure selection operator. In UV space, the faces were never connected to begin with;
      it only seemed that way because *Sticky Selection* automatically selected the vertices of the neighboring faces.
      *Select Split* deselects those vertices again.

      As an alternative to *Select Split*, you can set the *Sticky Selection Mode* to *Disabled*.

Select Overlap
   Selects all UV faces that overlap each other.


.. _bpy.ops.uv.shortest_path_select:
.. _bpy.ops.uv.shortest_path_pick:

Shortest Path
=============

.. reference::

   :Mode:      Edit Mode
   :Menu:      :menuselection:`Select --> Select Linked --> Shortest Path`
   :Shortcut:  :kbd:`Ctrl-LMB`

Selects all the UV elements along the shortest path between two elements: the two selected elements when
activated using the menu, or the active one and the clicked one when activated using the shortcut.

Face Stepping
   For vertices: allows the path to step across faces, following their diagonal rather than
   their edges.

   For edges: selects disconnected edges that are perpendicular to the path (edge ring),
   rather than connected edges along the path (edge loop).

   For faces: allows the path to go through faces that only share a vertex, rather than an edge.
Topology Distance
   Calculates the distance by simply counting edges rather than measuring their lengths.
Fill Region :kbd:`Shift-Ctrl-LMB`
   Selects all shortest paths (rather than just one).
Dashed Line Options
   Allows to only select elements at regular intervals, creating a "dashed line" rather
   than a continuous one.

   Deselected
      The number of deselected elements in the repetitive sequence.
   Selected
      The number of selected elements in the repetitive sequence.
   Offset
      The number of elements to offset the sequence by.

================

.. reference::

   :Mode:      Edit Mode
   :Shortcut:  :kbd:`Alt-LMB`, or :kbd:`Shift-Alt-LMB` for extending the existing selection.

Holding :kbd:`Alt` while clicking an edge selects that edge and then expands the selection as far as
possible in the two directions parallel to it. (While this of course works for selecting edge "loops"
that go all the way around a mesh, it also works if there's no loop.)

You can additionally hold :kbd:`Shift` to extend the current selection rather than replacing it.

.. seealso::

   Mesh edit :ref:`Select Edge Loops <bpy.ops.mesh.loop_select>`.

.. reference::

   :Mode:      Edit Mode
   :Shortcut:  :kbd:`Ctrl-Alt-LMB`, or :kbd:`Shift-Ctrl-Alt-LMB` for extending the existing selection.

Holding :kbd:`Ctrl-Alt` while clicking an edge selects that edge and then expands the selection
as far as possible in the two directions perpendicular to it. (While this of course works for selecting
edge "rings" that go all the way around a mesh, it also works if there's no ring.)

## Introduction

.. index:: Editors; Video Sequencer

************
Introduction
************

The Video Sequencer allows you to place images, videos, sounds, and scenes
on a timeline and combine them into a new video. This section only describes its UI;
to read more about its usage, see the :doc:`Video Editing </video_editing/index>` section.


Editor Layout
=============

The Video Sequencer is composed of multiple regions.
They are described in more detail in the next sections.
Figure 1 shows the combined *Sequencer & Preview* view type:

.. figure:: /images/editors_vse_overview.svg

   Figure 1: The Video Sequencer Editor shown in the Sequencer & Preview view type.

Header
   Contains menus and buttons for interacting with the editor.
   The header changes slightly depending on the selected view type (see below).
Preview
   Shows the output of the Sequencer at the time of the Playhead.
Sequencer
   Shows a timeline for managing the montage of strips.
Sidebar
   Shows the properties of the active strip.
   It's divided into panels and tabs. Toggle on or off with :kbd:`N`.
Toolbar
   Shows a list of tools. Toggle on or off with :kbd:`T`.


.. _bpy.types.SpaceSequenceEditor.view_type:

View Types
==========

The Video Sequencer has three view types which can be
changed using the View Type selector (see figure 1; top left).

.. figure:: /images/editors_vse_view_types.svg

   Figure 2: Three view types for the Video Sequence Editor

Sequencer
   View timeline and strip properties.
Preview
   View preview window and preview properties.
Sequencer & Preview
   Combined view of preview and timeline and their properties.

.. tip::

   Rather than having one Video Sequencer in the *Sequencer & Preview* mode, it can be more
   useful to have one in the *Sequencer* mode and another in the *Preview* mode,
   the reason being that *Sequencer & Preview* lacks most of the *Preview* tools.
   Blender's default *Video Editing* workspace offers this layout.


Performance
===========

Playback performance can be improved in several ways.

The method with the most impact is to allow the Video Sequencer to cache generated frames.
There are two levels of cache: a memory cache, which is enabled by default
(and can be enlarged if RAM allows), and a disk cache, which is slower but has more capacity.
Both of these can be configured in the :ref:`Preferences <prefs-system-video-sequencer>`.

Another way to improve performance is by using :ref:`Strip Proxies <bpy.types.SequenceProxy>`.
These are copies of source images and videos with a lower resolution and/or quality,
making them faster to load than the originals.


## Sequencer Preview


*******************
Sequencer & Preview
*******************

This view type shows both the preview and the sequencer inside one editor.

.. figure:: /images/editors_vse_combi-sequencer-preview.png

   Figure 1: Combined Sequencer & Preview

In general, it's better to avoid this view type and instead have two editors,
one serving as the *Preview* and the other as the *Sequencer*.
Reasons for this include:

- Most of the *Preview* tools, such as Move and Rotate, are not available
  in *Sequencer & Preview*.
- You can't add a small editor (such as a File Browser) on the side that only
  takes up the height of the preview.
- You can't maximize the preview on another screen.

One way of getting two separate editors is to simply open the default
*Video Editing* :doc:`workspace </interface/window_system/workspaces>`.
(You may need to click the "+" icon to the right of the tabs to find it.)

Preview During Transform
   When enabled, previews the strip's new first/last frame while dragging its left/right handle.

----------

Refresh All
   Reloads external files and refreshes the current frame preview.
   This is useful when you modified an external file or made a change in a scene that Blender
   didn't detect.

----------

Frame Selected
   Pan and zoom the view to focus on the selected image.
Fit Preview in Window :kbd:`Home`
   Pan and zoom the view so that the entire video is visible.
   This enables *Zoom to Fit*.

Zoom
   Menu with convenient zoom levels and operations.
   The zoom levels are calculated based on the images resolution compared to the screen resolution.

   - 12.5% (1:8) :kbd:`Numpad8` zoom out to a factor of 12.5%.
   - 25% (1:4) :kbd:`Numpad4` zoom out to a factor of 25%.
   - 50% (1:2) :kbd:`Numpad2` zoom out to a factor of 50%.
   - 100% (1:1) :kbd:`Numpad1` resets the zoom to 100%.
   - 200% (2:1) :kbd:`Ctrl-Numpad2` zoom in to a factor of 200%.
   - 400% (4:1) :kbd:`Ctrl-Numpad4` zoom in to a factor of 400%.
   - 800% (8:1) :kbd:`Ctrl-Numpad8` zoom in to a factor of 800%.

   Zoom In/Out :kbd:`Wheel`
      Zooms the view in or out.
   Zoom to Fit :kbd:`Shift-Home`
      Like *Frame All*, but uses as much space in the editor as possible.
   Zoom Region :kbd:`Shift-B`
      Zoom in the view to the nearest item contained in the border.

.. _bpy.types.SpaceSequenceEditor.use_zoom_to_fit:

Auto Zoom
   As long as this option is enabled, the preview will automatically zoom to keep the
   video size synchronized with the editor size.

----------

Proxy
   See :doc:`/editors/video_sequencer/sequencer/sidebar/proxy`.

----------

Sequence Render Image
   Show the current frame preview as a Render Result where you can save it as an image file.
Sequence Render Animation
   Save previews of the frames in the scene range (or the preview range, if active) to a video file
   or a series of image files. See the :doc:`/render/output/properties/output` panel for details.

.. note::
   *Sequence Render Image* and *Sequence Render Animation* don't render the final video by default --
   specifically, they don't render Scene Strips, instead using the preview's
   :doc:`shading mode </editors/3dview/display/shading>` (which is initially Solid).

   To output a video where the Scene Strips are rendered, use the *Render* menu in the top-bar,
   or change :menuselection:`Sidebar --> View --> Scene Strip Display --> Shading` to *Rendered*.

----------

.. _bpy.ops.sequencer.export_subtitles:

Export Subtitles
   Exports :doc:`Text strips </video_editing/edit/montage/strips/text>`,

   :Panel:     :menuselection:`Sidebar --> View tab --> Frame Overlay`

The Frame Overlay lets you display a reference frame for comparing to the current frame.

.. _bpy.ops.sequencer.view_ghost_border:

Set Overlay Region
   Lets you drag a rectangle to define the bounds of the overlay.
   Instead of clicking this button, you can also press :kbd:`O` while hovering over the preview.

.. _bpy.types.SequenceEditor.overlay_frame:

Frame Offset
   The time offset between the reference frame and the current frame, in frames.

.. _bpy.types.SpaceSequenceEditor.overlay_frame_type:

Overlay Type
   How the reference frame should be displayed.

   :Rectangle: Display part of the reference frame (defined by the *Overlay Region*) on top of the current frame.
   :Reference: Display only the reference frame.
   :Current: Display only the current frame.

   .. tip::

      Each Video Sequencer editor can have its own *Overlay Type*.
      This means you can open two of them for showing the current frame and the reference frame next to each other.

.. _bpy.types.SequenceEditor.use_overlay_frame_lock:

Overlay Lock
   Keep displaying the same reference frame, even when moving to a different time point.
   This works by automatically adjusting the *Frame Offset*.

   :Panel:     :menuselection:`Sidebar --> View tab --> Scene Strip Display`

Controls how :doc:`Scene Strips </video_editing/edit/montage/strips/scene>`
are displayed in the preview.

.. _bpy.types.RenderSettings.sequencer_gl_preview:

Shading
   The :ref:`shading mode <view3d-viewport-shading>` to use.

.. _bpy.types.RenderSettings.use_sequencer_override_scene_strip:

Override Scene Settings
   Use the :doc:`Workbench render settings </render/workbench/index>` from the
   current scene rather than the scenes referenced by the strips.
   Only available for the *Wireframe* and *Solid* shading modes.

Metadata
========

.. reference::

   :Editor:    Video Sequencer
   :View Type: Preview
   :Panel:     :menuselection:`Sidebar --> Metadata tab`

Lists information that has been encoded in the currently visible movie or image file
(*not* the file referenced by the selected strip). This can include the filename,
the creation date, the camera model etc. This also works for images produced by Blender;
see :doc:`Render Output </render/output/properties/metadata>` for the metadata
that can be included in this case.

Other graphics programs may also store metadata,
but only the text in the header field "Comments" can be read.

Some of this metadata can also be made visible in the preview with the
:ref:`Metadata overlay <bpy.types.SequencerPreviewOverlay.show_metadata>`.

.. tip::

   The metadata can't be edited from Blender. Instead, you can use an external program such as exiftool.
   For example, the command to change the "Comments" field is:

   ``exiftool --comments="My new comment" name-of-file.png``

.. note::

   Metadata is only displayed for images/movies that don't have an effect applied.


## Toolbar

Tweak :kbd:`W`
   Lets you select images by clicking, and move them by dragging.
   Press :kbd:`W` to cycle between this tool and *Select Box*.

   :ref:`Select Box <tool-select-box>`
      Lets you select one image by clicking, or multiple images by dragging a rectangle.

Cursor
   Lets you move the :ref:`editors_sequencer_preview_2d-cursor` by clicking or dragging with :kbd:`LMB`.

   While dragging, you can press :kbd:`X` or :kbd:`Y` to constrain movement to an axis.

   If you need extra precision, you can hold :kbd:`Shift` to move the cursor more
   slowly than the mouse, or type a number to move it by an exact amount.

   The header shows how far the cursor has traveled, including the distance along each axis.

   Instead of this tool, you can also drag the mouse while holding :kbd:`Shift-RMB`
   (works with all tools) or adjust the 2D Cursor Location in :menuselection:`Sidebar --> View`.

   .. note::

      By default, the 2D Cursor is only shown while dragging it. To make it permanently
      visible, enable the *2D Cursor* :doc:`overlay </editors/video_sequencer/preview/display/overlays>`.

.. _tool-sequencer-preview-move:

Move :kbd:`G`
   Lets you move the selected images by dragging with :kbd:`LMB`.
   Alternatively, you can press :kbd:`G`, move the mouse, and finally click :kbd:`LMB` to confirm
   (or :kbd:`RMB` to cancel).

   If the :ref:`Active Tools <bpy.types.SpaceSequenceEditor.show_gizmo_tool>`
   gizmo is enabled, you can drag one of the colored arrows to only move along that one axis.
   You can also press :kbd:`X` or :kbd:`Y` while moving: press once to constrain to the
   corresponding global axis, a second time to constrain to the local axis,
   and a third time to remove the constraint again. Yet another way is to hold
   :kbd:`MMB` and move the mouse horizontally or vertically.

   If you need more precision, you can do one of the following while moving:

   - Hold :kbd:`Shift` to move more slowly.
   - Type a number to move by an exact amount.
   - Use the arrow keys.

   The header shows how far the image has moved, including the offset along each axis.

   Instead of using this tool, you can also adjust the :ref:`Position <bpy.types.SequenceTransform.offset>`
   in the Sidebar's *Strip* tab (only available in the *Sequencer* and *Sequencer & Preview* modes).

Rotate :kbd:`R`
   Lets you rotate the selected images by holding :kbd:`LMB` and moving the mouse in a circle.
   Alternatively, you can press :kbd:`R`, move the mouse, and finally click :kbd:`LMB` to confirm
   (or :kbd:`RMB` to cancel).

   Images are rotated around the :ref:`Pivot Point <bpy.types.SequencerToolSettings.pivot_point>`,
   so if it's off-center, the images will not just rotate but also move around it.

   If you need more precision, you can do one of the following while rotating:

   - Hold :kbd:`Shift` to rotate more slowly.
   - Hold :kbd:`Ctrl` to rotate in increments of 5 degrees.
   - Type a number to rotate by an exact amount.
   - Use the arrow keys.

   The header shows how much the image has rotated.

   Instead of using this tool, you can also adjust the :ref:`Rotation <bpy.types.SequenceTransform.rotation>`
   in the Sidebar's *Strip* tab (only available in the *Sequencer* and *Sequencer & Preview* modes).

Scale :kbd:`S`
   Lets you resize the selected images by dragging with :kbd:`LMB`.
   Alternatively, you can press :kbd:`S`, move the mouse, and finally click :kbd:`LMB` to confirm
   (or :kbd:`RMB` to cancel).

   If the :ref:`Active Tools <bpy.types.SpaceSequenceEditor.show_gizmo_tool>`
   gizmo is enabled, you can drag one of the colored lines to only scale along that one axis.
   You can also press :kbd:`X` or :kbd:`Y` while scaling: press once to constrain to the
   corresponding global axis, a second time to constrain to the local axis,
   and a third time to remove the constraint again. Yet another way is to hold
   :kbd:`MMB` and move the mouse horizontally or vertically.

   Images are scaled around the :ref:`Pivot Point <bpy.types.SequencerToolSettings.pivot_point>`,
   so if it's off-center and you scale down, the images will not just become smaller
   but also move towards it.

   If you need more precision, you can do one of the following while scaling:

   - Hold :kbd:`Shift` to scale more slowly.
   - Hold :kbd:`Ctrl` to scale in increments of 10%.
   - Type a number to scale by an exact factor (e.g. ``.5`` to make it half the size).
   - Use the arrow keys.

   The header shows the current scale factor.

   Instead of using this tool, you can also adjust the :ref:`Scale <bpy.types.SequenceTransform.scale>`
   in the Sidebar's *Strip* tab (only available in the *Sequencer* and *Sequencer & Preview* modes).

Transform
   Lets you move, rotate, and scale images all using one tool.

   .. figure:: /images/editors_vse_preview_toolbar_transform.png

      The Transform tool

   It works as follows:

   - Drag the cross in the center to move the image.
   - Drag the dot on the protruding line to rotate.
   - Drag one of the corners to scale equally along both axes.
   - Drag one of the sides to scale along just one axis.

Sample
   Lets you sample a pixel's color by holding :kbd:`LMB`. The editor will show the following information
   about it on the bottom:

   - The X and Y coordinates, in pixels relative to the top left corner.
   - The red, green, blue, and alpha components of the pixel, as decimal values between 0 and 1.
   - The red, green, and blue components of the pixel with :doc:`/render/color_management` applied.
   - The hue, saturation, value, and luminance components of the pixel with Color Management applied.

   :Header:    |pivot-icon| :menuselection:`Pivot Point`
   :Shortcut:  :kbd:`Period`

The Pivot Point is the point around which images are rotated and scaled.
It's indicated by the position of the selected tool's gizmo.

.. seealso::
   The :doc:`/editors/3dview/controls/pivot_point/index` of the 3D Viewport

Bounding Box Center
   Use the center of the rectangle that's wrapped as tightly as possible around the selected
   images' origin points.
Median Point
   Use the averaged-out position of the selected images' origin points.
2D Cursor
   Use the location of the :ref:`2D Cursor <editors_sequencer_preview_2d-cursor>`,
   for when you want to specify the pivot point by hand.
Individual Origins
   Rotate/scale each image around its own origin, rather than rotating/scaling
   all of them around the same single point like the other options do.


## Display Mode

.. _bpy.types.SpaceSequenceEditor.display_mode:

************
Display Mode
************

Using this pop-over, you can choose between displaying the preview image
or a scope that visualizes its color distribution.


Image Preview
=============

Previews what the final video will look like,
and lets you change the image layout using various
:doc:`tools </editors/video_sequencer/preview/toolbar>`.


Luma Waveform
=============

This scope visualizes the luminosity (brightness) distribution of the image,
letting you see at a glance if there's enough contrast and if any areas are
under- or overexposed.

The scope works by plotting a curve for each scanline in the current video frame.
Another way of saying this is that each pixel column in the luma waveform
is a brightness histogram of the corresponding pixel column in the frame.
Specifically:

- The horizontal position of a pixel in the waveform refers to a pixel column in the frame.
- The vertical position of a pixel in the waveform refers to a brightness value,
  going from 0 at the bottom to 1 at the top.
- The brightness of a pixel in the waveform indicates how many pixels in the above frame column
  have the above brightness. If no pixels in the frame column have this brightness, the
  waveform pixel is black. If at least three pixels in the frame column have this brightness,
  the waveform pixel is white.

When this scope is selected, you have the following option in
:menuselection:`Sidebar --> View --> View Settings`:

Separate Colors
   Show three waveforms -- for the red, green, and blue color channels -- instead of just one
   for the overall image brightness.

The examples below show two images and their corresponding luma waveforms.

.. list-table::

   * - .. figure:: /images/video-editing_preview_display-mode_luma-waveform-example-1.png

          The various horizontal lines in the luma waveform
          match the uniform-colored lines of the picture. Note that the 'gray 20%'
          one-pixel width line (inside the yellow strip) is represented in the Luma waveform by a gray line.
          The two lines drawing an "X" are from the two monochrome gradients.
          Finally, the broken line matches the colored gradient at the bottom.

     - .. figure:: /images/video-editing_preview_display-mode_luma-waveform-example-2.png

          The curves are quite visible. We found a luma of 80-100% for the sky,
          a luma around 40% for the sea, and a luma of 10-20% for the mountains,
          growing around 40% for the sunny part.


Chroma Vectorscope
==================

This scope visualizes the color distribution of the image. Each point has:

- An angle indicating its hue.
- A distance-from-center indicating its saturation.
- A brightness indicating how many pixels in the video frame have the
  above hue and saturation.

.. list-table::

   * - .. figure:: /images/video-editing_preview_display-mode_example.jpg

          Example image.

     - .. figure:: /images/video-editing_preview_display-mode_vectorscope.png

          Corresponding Chroma Vectorscope.


Histogram
=========

Shows three overlapping graphs, one for each color channel. Within each graph:

- The X axis corresponds to color intensity, going from 0 on the left (black)
  to 1 on the right (fully red/green/blue).
- The Y axis corresponds to number of pixels.

Use this mode to balance out the tonal range in an image.
A well-balanced image should have nice and smooth distribution of color values.

## Channels

********
Channels
********

A channel is a horizontal track that's similar to a layer in an image editing program:
higher channels are displayed in front of lower ones.

Within each channel, you can create one or more
:doc:`strips </video_editing/edit/montage/strips/introduction>`, which contain either
a segment of video content (a rendered scene, an external video file...)
or an :doc:`effect </video_editing/edit/montage/strips/effects/index>`
(color blending, blurring...). The X axis represents time, so the further a strip
is placed to the right, the later it will play in the final video.

While a channel can contain multiple strips, they can't overlap each other.
If you want two strips to play at the same time, you need to place them in different channels.

.. _bpy.types.SequenceTimelineChannel:

Channel Region
==============

The Channel region sits on the left side of the editor and contains the channel properties
listed below. Its visibility can be toggled with :menuselection:`View --> Channels`.

.. _bpy.types.SequenceTimelineChannel.name:

Name
   The name of the channel. Double-click to change.

.. _bpy.types.SequenceTimelineChannel.mute:

Mute Channel
   Disable the entire channel so that none of its strips can be seen (or heard) in the final video.
   Note that you can also mute individual strips.

.. _bpy.types.SequenceTimelineChannel.lock:

Lock Channel
   Lock the entire channel to protect all its strips against accidental changes.
   Note that you can also lock individual strips.

.. _bpy.types.SequencerTimelineOverlay.show_thumbnails:

Thumbnails
   Displays thumbnails across the full width of each Movie or Image strip.
   The thumbnail size depends on the vertical zoom level (which can be adjusted
   by dragging up and down with :kbd:`Ctrl-MMB`). Zooming in results in taller
   strips with bigger, but fewer thumbnails. Zooming out results in narrower
   strips with smaller, but more thumbnails.


.. _bpy.types.SequencerTimelineOverlay.show_strip_tag_color:

Color Tags
   Displays each strip in its designated custom color (if applied) rather than a
   :ref:`color representing its type <sequencer-strip-colors>`. To set a custom color,
   either click the *Color Tag* button next to the strip's name in
   :menuselection:`Sidebar --> Strip`, or use *Set Color Tag* in the strip's context menu.

.. _bpy.ops.sequencer.previewrange_set:

Range
   Set Preview Range :kbd:`P`
      Interactively define the frame range used for preview playback/rendering.

      As long as this range is active, playback will be limited to it, letting you repeatedly view a
      segment of the video without having to manually rewind each time. It also limits the range
      that gets rendered by *Sequence Render Animation* (see below).
   Set Preview Range to Strips
      Apply a preview range that encompasses the selected strips.
   Clear Preview Range :kbd:`Alt-P`
      Clears the preview range.
   Set Start Frame :kbd:`Ctrl-Home`
      Set the Start frame of the scene to the current frame.
   Set End Frame :kbd:`Ctrl-End`
      Set the End frame of the scene to the current frame.
   Set Frame Range to Strips
      Set the Start and End frames of the scene so they encompass the selected strips.

----------

Sequence Render Image
   Show the current frame preview as a Render Result where you can save it as an image file.
Sequence Render Animation
   Save previews of the frames in the scene range (or the preview range, if active) to a video file
   or a series of image files. See the :doc:`/render/output/properties/output` panel for details.

.. note::
   *Sequence Render Image* and *Sequence Render Animation* don't render the final video by default --
   specifically, they don't render Scene Strips, instead using the preview's
   :doc:`shading mode </editors/3dview/display/shading>` (which is initially Solid).

   To output a video where the Scene Strips are rendered, use the *Render* menu in the top-bar,
   or change :menuselection:`Sidebar --> View --> Scene Strip Display --> Shading` to *Rendered*.
   The latter option is only available if the Video Sequencer is in the *Preview* or
   *Sequencer & Preview* mode.

----------

Export Subtitles
   Exports :doc:`Text strips </video_editing/edit/montage/strips/text>`,
   which can act as subtitles, to a `SubRip <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SubRip>`__ file (``.srt``).
   The exported file contains all Text strips in the video sequence.

----------

Toggle Sequencer/Preview :kbd:`Ctrl-Tab`
   Switch the editor mode between *Sequencer* and *Preview*.

----------

Area
   Area controls. See the :doc:`user interface </interface/window_system/areas>`
   documentation for more information.


Marker Menu
-----------

:doc:`Markers </animation/markers>` are used to denote frames with key points or significant events
within an animation. Like with most animation editors, markers are shown at the bottom of the editor.

.. figure:: /images/editors_graph-editor_introduction_markers.png

   Markers in animation editor.

See :ref:`Editing Markers <animation-markers-editing>` for details.


Main View
=========

Adjusting the View
------------------

Use these shortcuts to adjust the view:

- Pan: :kbd:`MMB`
- Horizontal scroll: use :kbd:`Ctrl-Wheel`, or drag the horizontal scrollbar.
- Vertical scroll: use :kbd:`Shift-Wheel`, or drag the vertical scrollbar.
- Zoom: :kbd:`Wheel`
- Scale view: :kbd:`Ctrl-MMB` and drag left/right (horizontal scale) or up/down (vertical scale).
  Alternatively, you can drag the circles on the scrollbars with :kbd:`LMB`.

Playhead
--------

The Playhead is the blue vertical line with the current time at the top. It can be moved
in the following ways:

* Jump or scrub: click or drag :kbd:`LMB` in the scrubbing area at the top of the timeline.
* Jump or scrub (alternative): click or drag :kbd:`Shift-RMB` anywhere in the timeline.
  If you start dragging on a strip, that strip will be highlighted and displayed *solo* in the preview
  (all other strips are temporarily muted).
* Move in single-frame increments: :kbd:`Left`, :kbd:`Right`, or :kbd:`Alt-Wheel`.
* Jump to the start or end frame of the scene (or :ref:`preview range <bpy.ops.sequencer.previewrange_set>`,
  if active): :kbd:`Shift-Left` or :kbd:`Shift-Right`.

While dragging with :kbd:`LMB` or :kbd:`Shift-RMB`, you can additionally hold :kbd:`Ctrl`
to snap to the start and end points of strips.

If scrubbing (or regular playback) performs poorly, you can speed it up by creating
:doc:`proxies </editors/video_sequencer/sequencer/sidebar/proxy>`.

.. hint::

   The current frame is synchronized across all editors, so if you move the Playhead in the
   Timeline editor for example, it will move in the Video Sequence editor as well (and vice versa).


## Cache


*****
Cache
*****

The Cache is used to save preview frames in memory,
so they can later be displayed much faster than if they were rendered from scratch.
Cache capacity can be set in the :doc:`System tab </editors/preferences/system>` of the Preferences.

.. seealso::

   Which frames are cached can be visualized by enabling
   :ref:`Show Cache <bpy.types.SequencerCacheOverlay.show_cache>`.


Cache Settings
==============

.. reference::

   :Panel:     :menuselection:`Sidebar --> Cache --> Cache Settings`

In this panel, you can select the preview rendering stages at which strip images should be cached.
These settings apply to all strips.

Cache
   Raw
      Cache raw images right after they're read from the drive, for faster tweaking of strip parameters
      at the cost of memory usage.
   Pre-processed
      Cache strip images after applying cropping, scaling, saturation and so on,
      for faster tweaking of effects at the cost of memory usage.
   Composite
      Cache strip images after blending with lower channels and applying effects,
      for faster tweaking of stacked strips at the cost of memory usage.
   Final
      Cache the final rendered frame.


Display
-------

Visualize cached images on the timeline.

.. _bpy.types.SequencerCacheOverlay.show_cache_:

Cache
   Raw
      Visualize cached raw images on the timeline.
   Pre-processed
      Visualize cached pre-processed images on the timeline.
   Composite
      Visualize cached composite images on the timeline.
   Final
      Visualize cached final images on the timeline.


Strip Cache
===========

.. reference::

   :Panel:     :menuselection:`Sidebar --> Cache --> Cache Settings`

This panel sets the types of images that will be cached for the active strip.
When enabled, these properties override the above `Cache Settings`_.

Cache
   Raw
      Cache raw images read from drive, for faster tweaking of strip parameters at the cost of memory usage.
   Preprocessed
      Cache preprocessed images, for faster tweaking of effects at the cost of memory usage.
   Composite
      Cache intermediate composited images, for faster tweaking of stacked strips at the cost of memory usage.

   :Panel:     :menuselection:`Sidebar region --> Modifiers --> Modifiers`

.. figure:: /images/video-editing_sequencer_sidebar_modifiers_panel.png
   :align: right

Modifiers are used to make adjustments to the image, like contrast,
brightness, saturation, color balance and applying masks.

You can add these modifiers directly to a media strip,
or you can use them within an :doc:`Adjustment Layer </video_editing/edit/montage/strips/adjustment>`
strip, making them apply to several media strips in one go.

Use Linear Modifiers
   Calculates modifiers in :ref:`linear color space <color-management-linear-space>` instead of the
   :ref:`Sequencer color space <bpy.types.ColorManagedSequencerColorspaceSettings.name>`.

   Calculating modifiers in linear space will match the image processing of the compositor.
   In most cases, this should be enabled; working in a non-linear workflow could have unpredictable results.
Copy to Selected Strips
   Copies the modifiers to the selected strips, either replacing their current modifiers or appending to them.


Common Options
==============

Each modifier has several buttons at its top:

Mute (eye icon)
   Disables the modifier. Useful to compare the image with or without modifications.
Move (up/down arrow icon)
   These two buttons change the modifier's position in the stack which affects its computation order.
Remove ``X``
   Deletes the modifier from the stack.


Masking
-------

You can mask each modifier to limit the area of the image it affects. This can be done using
either a :doc:`Mask </movie_clip/masking/introduction>` or another strip.

Mask Input Type
   Type of input data used for the mask.

   :Strip:
      Use the grayscale representation of another strip's image.
   :Mask:
      Use a Mask data-block.

Mask
   The Strip or Mask data-block to use.

Mask Time :guilabel:`Mask Input Only`
   How the start frame of the mask is calculated.

   :Relative: Mask animation is offset to the start of the strip.
   :Absolute: Mask animation is in sync with the scene frame.


Types
=====

Currently, the following modifiers are supported:


.. index:: Video Sequencer Modifiers; Brightness/Contrast Modifier
.. _bpy.types.BrightContrastModifier:

Brightness/Contrast Modifier
----------------------------

Adjusts the brightness and contrast of the image.


.. index:: Video Sequencer Modifiers; Color Balance Modifier
.. _bpy.types.ColorBalanceModifier:

Color Balance Modifier
----------------------

Color balance adjustments, either by the Lift/Gamma/Gain or the Offset/Power/Slope method.

This modifier works similar to the :doc:`Color Balance Node </compositing/types/color/adjust/color_balance>`.

.. figure:: /images/video-editing_sequencer_sidebar_color-balance-modifier.png
   :align: right

Depending on the selected method, the following operations can be applied to the color values in the
sequencer color space:

Lift/Gamma/Gain
   Lift
      Increases the value of dark colors.
   Gamma
      Adjusts midtones.
   Gain
      Adjusts highlights.

Offset/Power/Slope (ASC-CDL)
   The following formula is applied to each RGB color value separately: :math:`c_{out} =  (c_{in}×s + o)^p`

   Slope
      The multiplier :math:`s` influences all color values except black. Its effect is stronger
      the brighter the source color is.
   Offset
      Shifts color values after applying Slope by adding the Offset :math:`o` to them. Note that
      the selected value shown in the UI will be reduced by 1, so the default value of 1 means
      effectively no offset is applied.
   Power
      Overall exponent :math:`p`, which mainly adjusts the midtones.


.. index:: Video Sequencer Modifiers; Curves Modifier
.. _bpy.types.CurvesModifier:

Curves Modifier
---------------

Color and RGB curves.

This modifier works the same as the :doc:`/compositing/types/color/adjust/rgb_curves`.


.. index:: Video Sequencer Modifiers; Hue Correct Modifier

The mask modifier is used to affect the :term:`Alpha Channel` of the current strip.

.. _bpy.types.SequenceModifier.input_mask_type:

Mask Input Type
   Type of input data used for the mask.

   :Strip:
      Use the grayscale representation of another strip to affect the alpha of the current strip.
   :Mask:
      Use a mask data-block to affect the alpha of the current strip.

.. _bpy.types.SequenceModifier.input_mask_id:
.. _bpy.types.SequenceModifier.input_mask_strip:

Mask
   The Strip or Mask data-block to use.

.. _bpy.types.SequenceModifier.mask_time:

Mask Time :guilabel:`Mask Input Only`
   How the start frame of the mask is calculated.

   :Relative: Mask animation is offset to the start of the strip.
   :Absolute: Mask animation is in sync with the scene frame.


.. index:: Video Sequencer Modifiers; Tone Map Modifier

Tone Map Modifier
-----------------

Used to map one set of colors to another in order to approximate the appearance
of high dynamic range images in a medium that has a more limited dynamic range.

This modifier works the same as the :doc:`Tone Map Node </compositing/types/color/adjust/tone_map>`.


.. index:: Video Sequencer Modifiers; White Balance Modifier
.. _bpy.types.WhiteBalanceModifier:

White Balance Modifier
----------------------

Used to adjust the white balance by choosing the color that should be white.

This modifier can be used to emphasize or suppress sound frequencies.
The range is limited to 35Hz - 20kHz and +/-35dB.


## Proxy


*****
Proxy
*****

As projects involve increasingly high-resolution footage,
the performance of the video preview can decrease drastically.
To combat this, Blender can generate proxies -- copies of the original footage stored at a
lower quality and/or resolution -- to maintain a smooth editing experience without
compromising visual fidelity in the end result.

The quickest way to set up proxies for videos is to simply select a
:ref:`Proxy Render Size <bpy.types.SpaceSequenceEditor.proxy_render_size>`
in the *View* tab (visible when the editor is in *Preview* or
*Sequencer & Preview* mode). This will automatically enable the selected
proxy resolution in all the strips and start generating the downscaled video files.

You can use the *Proxy* tab if you want to configure proxies in more detail
(or create proxies for image sequences).

Proxy Settings
==============

.. reference::

   :Panel:     :menuselection:`Sidebar region --> Proxy --> Proxy Settings`

Contains scene-wide proxy settings.

.. _bpy.types.SequenceEditor.proxy_storage:

Storage
   How proxies are stored for the project.

   :Per Strip: Each strip can specify where to store its proxies (see below).
   :Project: All proxies are stored in one directory.

      .. _bpy.types.SequenceEditor.proxy_dir:

      Proxy Directory
         The location to store the proxies for the project.

.. _bpy.ops.sequencer.enable_proxies:

Set Selected Strip Proxies
   Shows a pop-over that lets you choose the resolution(s) to generate
   and whether to overwrite existing proxy files. Once you confirm with the *Set* button,
   your choices are applied to the selected strips. You can view and tweak the
   settings for individual strips in the *Strip Proxy & Timecode* panel (see below).

   In the *Preview* mode, where the *Proxy* tab is not available,
   this is instead done through the menu :menuselection:`View --> Proxy --> Setup`.

.. _bpy.ops.sequencer.rebuild_proxy:

Rebuild Proxy and Timecode Indices
   Generates proxies and time indices for the selected strips.

   In the *Preview* mode, where the *Proxy* tab is not available,
   this is instead done through the menu :menuselection:`View --> Proxy --> Rebuild`.

.. _bpy.types.SequenceProxy:
.. _bpy.types.MovieSequence.use_proxy:

Strip Proxy & Timecode
======================

.. reference::

   :Panel:     :menuselection:`Sidebar region --> Proxy & Timecode --> Strip Proxy & Timecode`

.. figure:: /images/video-editing_sequencer_sidebar_proxy_panel.png
   :align: right

Contains strip-specific proxy settings. The checkbox in the header can be used to
enable/disable proxy generation.

Custom Proxy
   Directory
      By default, all generated proxy videos are stored to
      the folder ``<path of original footage>/BL_proxy/<clip name>``,
      but this can be changed to a custom directory using this option.
   File
      Allows you to use preexisting proxies.

.. _bpy.types.SequenceProxy.build:

Resolutions
   The resolution(s) of the proxy videos to generate; multiple sizes can be selected.

.. _bpy.types.SequenceProxy.use_overwrite:

Overwrite
   Whether to overwrite existing proxy files or keep them.

.. _bpy.types.SequenceProxy.quality:

Quality
   The video/image quality for proxies.

.. _bpy.types.SequenceProxy.timecode:

:term:`Timecode` Index
   When you are working with footage directly copied from a camera without preprocessing it,
   there might be numerous artifacts, mostly due to seeking to a given frame in the sequence.
   This happens because such footage usually does not have correct frame rate values in the file header.
   This issue can still arise when the source clip has the same frame rate as the scene settings.
   In order for Blender to correctly calculate the frames and frame rate there are two possible solutions:

   #. Preprocess your video with e.g. MEncoder to repair the file header and insert the correct keyframes.
   #. Use the Timecode Index option in Blender.

   :None:
      Ignore generated timecodes, seek in movie stream based on calculated timestamp.
   :Record Run:
      Seek based on timestamps read from movie stream, giving the best match between scene and movie times.
   :Record Run No Gaps:
      Effectively convert movie to an image sequence,
      ignoring incomplete or dropped frames, and changes in frame rate.

   .. note::

      *Record Run* is the Timecode Index which usually is best to use, but if the source file is totally damaged,
      *Record Run No Gaps* will be the only chance of getting an acceptable result.


## Strip


*****
Strip
*****

Header
======

Type
   Strip type, represented by an icon.

.. _bpy.types.Sequence.name:

Name
   A text field to adjust the name of the strip, which is shown on the strip in the timeline.

   .. _bpy.ops.sequencer.strip_color_tag_set:

   Color Tag
      Strips are given a :ref:`Default Color <sequencer-strip-colors>` based on their type;
      using the color tag, you can assign a custom color to help organize your sequence.

Mute
   Uncheck to prevent the strip from producing output.


Compositing
===========

.. reference::

   :Panel:     :menuselection:`Sidebar --> Strip --> Compositing`

Blend
   The method for blending the current strip with strips in lower channels.
   See :term:`Blend Modes` for more information.
Opacity
   The opacity (:term:`alpha <Alpha Channel>`) of the strip.

   When this property is animated, the opacity is drawn as an overlay on the strip.
   The overlay will look like a dark section that follows the animation curve.
   This can be hidden by disabling the :ref:`F-Curves <bpy.types.SequencerTimelineOverlay.show_fcurves>`.


.. _bpy.types.SequenceTransform:

Transform
=========

.. reference::

   :Panel:     :menuselection:`Sidebar --> Strip --> Transform`

.. _bpy.types.SequenceTransform.filter:

Filter
   The technique used to estimate the values of pixels at non-integer coordinates within the image.

   :Auto:
      Automatically choose filter based on scaling factor.

      - No scale, no rotation, integer positions: *Nearest*
      - Scaling up by more than 2x: *Cubic Mitchell*
      - Scaling down by more than 2x: *Box*
      - Otherwise: Bilinear
   :Nearest: No interpolation; uses nearest neighboring pixel (fastest).
   :Bilinear: Interpolate between 2×2 samples.
   :Cubic Mitchell: Cubic Mitchell filter on 4×4 samples.
   :Cubic B-Spline: Cubic B-Spline filter (blurry but no ringing) on 4×4 samples.
   :Box: Averages source image samples that fall under destination pixel.

.. _bpy.types.SequenceTransform.offset:

Position X, Y
   Used to move the frames along the X and Y axis.

.. _bpy.types.SequenceTransform.scale:

Scale X, Y
   Scale the image on the X and Y axis.

.. _bpy.types.SequenceTransform.rotation:

Rotation
   Rotates the input two-dimensionally along the Z axis.

.. _bpy.types.ImageSequence.use_flip:

Mirror
   Mirrors the image along the X axis (left to right) or the Y axis (top to bottom).


.. _bpy.types.SequenceCrop:

Crop
====

.. reference::

   :Panel:     :menuselection:`Sidebar --> Strip --> Crop`

Used to crop the source image. Use *Top*, *Left*,
*Bottom*, and *Right* to control the number of pixels that are cropped.


Video
=====

.. reference::

   :Panel:     :menuselection:`Sidebar --> Strip --> Video`

Strobe
   Display every nth frame.
   For example, if you set this to 10,  the strip will only display frames 1, 11, 21, 31, 41... of the source.

   It is important to realize that this property is a float value.
   This allows you to strobe effect synced exactly to a beat.

Reverse Frames
   Plays the strip backwards starting from the last frame in the sequence.


Color
=====

.. reference::

   :Panel:     :menuselection:`Sidebar --> Strip --> Color`

Saturation
   Adjusts the vividness of colors in the image.
Multiply
   Multiplies the colors by this value. This will increase the brightness.
Multiply Alpha
   Multiply alpha along with color channels when using the *Multiply* option.
Convert to Float
   Converts input to float data.


.. _vse_sidebar_strip_sound:

Sound
=====

.. reference::

   :Panel:     :menuselection:`Sidebar --> Strip --> Sound`

Working with sound is documented further at :ref:`bpy.types.SoundSequence`.

.. _bpy.types.SoundSequence.volume:

Volume
   Adjusts the perceived loudness or intensity of the sound.

   When this property is animated, the volume is drawn as an overlay on the strip.
   The overlay will look like a dark section that follows the animation curve.
   This can be hidden by disabling the :ref:`F-Curves <bpy.types.SequencerTimelineOverlay.show_fcurves>`.
   The value is also reflected in the waveform.

.. figure:: /images/vse_setup_project_striptypes_sound-pan.png
   :align: right
   :width: 220px

.. _bpy.types.SoundSequence.pan:

Pan
   Used to pan the audio between speakers in multichannel audio.
   Only mono sources can be panned; if the source file is not mono, enable *Mono* to mix the channels together.

   This value basically represents the angle at
   which it's played if you multiply the value by 90 degrees.

   For stereo, output panning works from left (-1) to center (0) and finally right (1).

   To address rear speakers, you can pan to those with higher values,
   where -2 is back left and 2 is back right.

   .. tip::

      For smooth animation you can assign values outside the soft bounds,
      since the angle wraps around over multiple rotations.

   .. note::

      The number of audio channels can be configured in the
      :ref:`Audio Output <render-output-video-encoding-audio>` settings.

.. _bpy.types.Sound.use_mono:

Mono
   Mixdown all audio channels into a single channel.

.. _bpy.types.SoundSequence.show_waveform:

Display Waveform
   Display an approximate waveform of the sound file inside of the Sound strip.
   The waveform reflects strip volume and its animation using :doc:`keyframes </animation/keyframes/introduction>`.

   Clipping audio, i.e. values over 100% amplitude, will be shown in red.

   This option is only visible if the :ref:`Waveforms overlay <bpy.types.SequencerTimelineOverlay>` is set to *Strip*.

.. _sequencer-strips-properties-time:

Time
====

.. reference::

   :Panel:     :menuselection:`Sidebar --> Strip --> Time`

The Time panel is used to control source and timeline position of the strip.

Lock (padlock icon in panel header)
   Prevents the strip from being moved.

.. _bpy.types.Sequence.show_retiming_keys:

Show Retiming Keys
   Toggle visibility and selectability of :ref:`Retiming keys <sequencer-editing-retiming>`.

.. _bpy.types.Sequence.channel:

Channel
   Changes the channel number, or row, of the strip.

.. _bpy.types.Sequence.frame_start:

Start
   Changes the starting frame of the strip, which is the same as selecting and moving the strip.

.. _bpy.types.Sequence.frame_final_duration:

Duration
   Changes the length (in frames) of the strip. This works by changing the end frame,
   which is the same as selecting and moving the strip's right handle.
End
   Shows the ending time and frame of the strip.

.. _bpy.types.Sequence.frame_offset_start:
.. _bpy.types.Sequence.frame_offset_end:

Strip Offset Start/End
   Positive values will move the strip's handles inwards, making it start later than the start
   of the source material and stop before its end. This lets you trim down the source material
   to the part you need. You can enable the
   :ref:`Offsets overlay <bpy.types.SpaceSequeSequencerTimelineOverlaynceEditor.show_strip_offset>`
   to see the start and end of the full source file.

   Negative values will move the strip's handles outwards, making it start earlier than the start
   of the source material and stop after its end. This lets you show the first and/or last frame
   as a frozen image for some time.

   Instead of adjusting these offsets in the Sidebar, you can also drag the strip's handles.

.. _bpy.types.MovieSequence.animation_offset_start:
.. _bpy.types.MovieSequence.animation_offset_end:
.. _sequencer-duration-hard:

Hold Offset Start/End
   Used for trimming frames off the start/end of the source material. At first sight, this
   does the same as the *Strip Offset* properties, but you can in fact combine them
   to hold (freeze) a frame other than the first or last one. For example, if you set the
   *Hold Offset Start* to 10 and the *Strip Offset Start* to -20, the video will first show
   the 11th frame of the source for 21 frames, and then play the remaining frames.

Current Frame
   The Playhead's frame number relative to the start of the strip.


Source
======

.. reference::

   :Panel:     :menuselection:`Sidebar --> Strip --> Source`

The Source panel shows (and lets you change) the file which the strip points to,
as well as how this file should be displayed.

File
   The full path of the source file.

Color Space
   The color space of the source file.

   The list of color spaces depends on the active :ref:`OCIO config <ocio-config>`.
   The default supported color spaces are described in detail here:
   :ref:`Default OpenColorIO Configuration <ocio-config-default-color-spaces>`
Alpha Mode
   If the source file has an Alpha (transparency) channel, you can choose between
   :term:`Straight Alpha` and :term:`Premultiplied Alpha`.
Stream Index :guilabel:`Movie Strip`
   The video stream to use, in case there are multiple.
Deinterlace
   Applies deinterlacing to analog video.

Source Information
   Displays information about the strip's media.

   Resolution
      Resolution of the active strip's image output.
   FPS :guilabel:`Movie Strip`
      The frame rate encoded into the video file.
      If this value does not match the scene's :ref:`Frame Rate <bpy.types.RenderSettings.fps>`,
      the perceived speed of the media will be wrong unless the speed is
      :ref:`changed <video_editing-change_fps>` to account for the difference.


Options for Image Strips
------------------------

Directory
   The directory that contains the source file(s).

Filename
   The name of the source file. For image sequences, this will be different for each frame.

Change Data/Files
   Opens a File Browser to let you select a new set of images (as an alternative to modifying
   the above textboxes). Same as :menuselection:`Strip --> Inputs --> Change Paths/Files`.


Options for Sound Strips
------------------------

Sound
   :ref:`Data-block menu <ui-data-block>` to select a sound.
File Path
   Path to the file used by the selected sound :ref:`data-block <ui-data-block>`.
Pack
   :doc:`Pack </files/blend/packed_data>` the sound into the blend-file.

.. _bpy.types.Sound.use_memory_cache:

Caching
   Sound file is decoded and loaded into the RAM.

Source Information
   Displays information about the strip's media.

   Samplerate
      The number of samples per second the audio is encoded at.
   Channels

Blade
*****

.. reference::

   :Mode:      Sequencer Mode
   :Tool:      :menuselection:`Toolbar --> Blade`
   :Shortcut:  :kbd:`K`, :kbd:`Shift-K`

Cuts a strip in two. Specifically, it first shortens the strip so it only shows the content
up to the cut point, then adds a second strip that shows the content after the cut point.

Splitting be done in two different ways:

- Select the tool in the Toolbar and click a strip at the time point where you want to split it.
- Alternatively, select one or more strips, place the Playhead at the time point where you want to
  split them, and press one of the keyboard shortcuts below.

You can choose between the following split types:

Soft :kbd:`K`
   After splitting, it's still possible to restore the cut content in the new strips
   by dragging their handles.

Hard :kbd:`Shift-K`
   After splitting, it's not possible to restore the cut content by dragging handles.
   However, you can still restore it by changing the :ref:`Hold Offset <sequencer-duration-hard>`
   in the Sidebar.
